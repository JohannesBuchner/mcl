.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBclminfo\fP computes several numbers indicative for the efficiency with
with a clustering captures the edge mass of a given graph\&.
Use it in conjunction with \fBclmdist\fP to determine which clusterings
you accept\&. See the EXAMPLES section in \fBclmdist\fP
for an example of \fBclmdist\fP and \fBclminfo\fP (and \fBclmmeet\fP) usage\&.
Output can be generated for multiple clusterings at the same time\&.

The first number is called the \fBefficiency\fP and is described in [1] (see
the \fBREFERENCES\fP section)\&. It tries to balance the dual aims of
capturing a lot of edges or edge weights and keeping the cluster footprint
or area fraction small\&. The efficiency number has several appealing
mathematical properties, cf\&. [1]\&. It is related to, but not derivable from,
the second and third numbers, the \fImass fraction\fP and the
\fIarea fraction\fP\&.

The second number is the mass fraction, which is defined as follows\&.
Let \fBe\fP be an edge of the graph\&. The clustering \fIcaptures\fP \fBe\fP
if the two nodes associated with \fBe\fP are in the same cluster\&.
Now the mass fraction is the joint weight of all captured edges divided
by the joint weight of all edges in the input graph\&.

The third number is the area fraction, which is roughly the sum of the
squares of all cluster sizes for all clusters in the clustering, divided by
the square of the number of nodes in the graph\&. It says \fIroughly\fP,
because the actual formula uses the quantity \fBN\fP*(\fBN-1\fP) wherever it
says square (of \fBN\fP) above\&. A low/high area fraction indicates a
fine-grained/coarse clustering\&.

The fourth number is the cluster link weight, which is the average
edge weight over all edges captured by the clustering\&.

The fifth number is the graph link weight, which is the average weight
over all edges in the graph\&.
.SH OPTIONS

.ZI 3m "\fB--adapt\fP (\fIallow domain mismatch\fP)"
\&
.br
The \fB--adapt\fP option allows the graph domain and cluster domain
not to match\&. \fBclmdist\fP will take the appropriate subclustering and
subgraph as it goes along\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-pi\fP f (\fIapply inflation beforehand\fP)"
\&
.br
Apply inflation to the graph matrix and compute the performance
measures for the result\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--append-pf\fP (\fIappend performance measures\fP)"
\&
.br
\fBclminfo\fP will reread each cluster file and append the computed
performance measures to it\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--append-gr\fP (\fIappend granularity measures\fP)"
\&
.br
\fBclminfo\fP will reread each cluster file and append the computed
granularity measures to it\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-tag\fP <str> (\fIwrite tag=<str> in performance section\fP)"
\&
.br
When appending, \fBclminfo\fP will include tag=<str> in the
performance section\&. This can be useful e\&.g\&. to indicate
the pre-inflation value corresponding with the section\&.
