.SH NAME
mcl \- The Markov Cluster Algorithm, aka the MCL algorithm\&.

\fBmcl\fP is a cluster algorithm for graphs\&. A single option controls the
granularity of the output clustering\&. This is the \fB-I\fP\ \&\fIinflation\fP
option, described further below\&.
.SH GETTING STARTED
There are two main modes of invocation\&. The most accessible is
\fIlabel mode\fP
that assumes label input\&. The input is then a file or stream in which each
line encodes an edge in terms of two labels and a numerical value, separated
by white space\&. The most basic example of usage is this:

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
   \fBmcl\fP <-|fname> \fB--abc\fP \fB-o\fP\ \&\fIfname-out\fP
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

The output is then a file where each line is a cluster of tab-separated
labels\&. MCL works natively with a numerical encoding of its input\&. This
\fImatrix input\fP is the second mode of operation\&. Label mode can save its
input for later use in matrix input\&. Here is how to do it\&.

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
   \fBmcl\fP <-|fname> \fB--abc\fP \fB-o\fP\ \&\fIfname-out\fP\e
      \fB-write-tab\fP\ \&\fImap-name\fP \fB-write-graph\fP\ \&\fIgraph-name\fP
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

Native mode (matrix input) is entered simply by \fInot\fP specifying
\fB--abc\fP\&. The input file should then have been created by an earlier
invocation of \fB-write-graph\fP\ \&\fIfname\fP or by other means,
e\&.g\&. \fBmcxload(1)\fP\&. It is
possible to obtain label output in native mode by specifying a label
dictionary, possibly one that was saved earlier using the
\fB-write-tab\fP\ \&\fIfname\fP option\&. An example is this:

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
   \fBmcl\fP <-|fname> \fB--yield-abc\fP \fB-o\fP\ \&\fIfname-out\fP\e
      \fB-strict-tab\fP\ \&\fIfname-map\fP
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

Here \fB-strict-tab\fP tells mcl that the input should not contain
labels other than found in the file \fBfname-map\fP\&. It is possible to
relax this by using \fB-restrict-tab\fP\ \&\fIfname-map\fP or
\fB-extend-tab\fP\ \&\fIfname-map\fP\&.

Label mode is very convenient for easy and fast exploration\&. A decided
advantage of full native mode (where both graph input and cluster output are
in matrix format) is that the data can easily be analyzed and subjected to
further processing\&. Second, input that is stored in native binary format
loads much faster than label data when the input data size grows large\&. If
neither of these is of concern then label mode may be entirely sufficient\&.
For more information on label mode and native mode refer to examples in this
manual and \fBmcxio(5)\fP\&.

\fBGranularity\fP
.br
If you want to explore cluster structure in graphs with MCL, do use
the \fB-I\fP\ \&\fIinflation\fP option with varying parameters
to obtain clusterings at different levels of granularity\&.

\fBClustering from blast files\fP
.br
Refer to the group of options discussed with
\fB--abc\fP\&. By way of a small example, consider these\&.

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
mcxdeblast --line-mode=abc --out=- hsfsp\&.blast | mcl - --abc -o -
mcxdeblast --m9 --line-mode=abc --out=- hsfsp\&.blast | mcl - --abc -o -
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

The single hyphens in this example (other than word-separators)
indicate that output is written to STDOUT or read from STDIN\&.
The blast files are respectively in default and column (-m8 or -m9) format\&.
They are parsed, the output is sent to mcl, and mcl sends a list of
tab-separated labels to STDOUT\&. All the \fCabc\fP strings serve to indicate
that the mode of communication between these programs is \fIlabel format\fP\&.
It is possible to cache the input graph in native mcl matrix format:

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
mcxdeblast --line-mode=-abc --out=- hsfsp\&.blast | \e
   mcxload -abc - --stream-mirror -o hsfsp\&.mcx -write-tab hsfsp\&.tab --write-binary
mcl hsfsp\&.mcx -use-tab hsfsp\&.tab -o  hsfsp\&.my-nice-clustering
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

The matrix is written in binary format to speed up
subsequent reads\&. The speed-up factor is approximately ten-fold\&.
For large graphs it is recommended to use binary format\&.
Keep in mind though that it is not portable across machines
and is not garantueed to be portable across different versions
of mcl or differently compiled versions of mcl\&.
\fBmcl\fP also accepts the \fB--write-binary\fP option, ensuring that
graphs written with \fB-write-graph\fP are output in binary
format\&.
The \fBmcxload(1)\fP \fB--mirror\fP option ensures that
the resulting graph is undirected\&. When mcl itself is in charge of processing
the label input (rather than mcxload as in the example under discussion)
it is not necessary to instruct mcl to do so\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The example invocation below assumes matrix input, as described in the
\fBmcxio(5)\fP section\&. Switching to label mode requires the input file to be in
label format and the addition of the \fB--abc\fP option\&.

\fBmcl\fP <-|fname>
\fB[-I\fP f (\fIinflation\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[-o\fP str (\fIfname\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[-scheme\fP k (\fIresource scheme\fP)\fB]\fP

These options are sufficient in 95 percent of the cases or more\&. The first
argument must be the name of a file containing a graph/matrix in the mcl
input format, or a hyphen to read from STDIN\&. With respect to clustering,
the \fB-I\fP option and \fB-scheme\fP
option are foremost relevant\&.

A mechanism for pipelines is supported (as of the first 1\&.003 release)\&.
Refer to the \fBPIPELINES\fP section for more information\&.
A prepackaged pipeline for BLAST data is present in the form of
\fBmclblastline(1)\fP\&. As of release 1\&.006 a lightweight BLAST clustering
mechanism is also supported\&. \fBGETTING STARTED\fP is a small introduction,
with some examples of using BLAST results\&.

The full listing of \fBmcl\fP options is shown below, separated
into parts corresponding with functional aspects such
as clustering, threading, verbosity, pruning and resource management,
automatic output naming, and dumping\&.
The \fB-scheme\fP parameter provides a single access point to the
pruning options, and should be sufficient in most cases\&.
\fBmcl\fP allows comprehensive tuning and access to its internals
for those who are interested, so it has many options\&.

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmcl\fP implements the \fBMCL algorithm\fP, short for the \fBMarkov cluster
algorithm\fP, a cluster algorithm for graphs developed by Stijn van Dongen at
the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands\&. The algorithm simulates flow using two simple algebraic
operations on matrices\&.
The inception of this flow process and the theory behind it are
described elsewhere (see \fBREFERENCES\fP)\&. Frequently asked questions
are answered in the \fBmclfaq(7)\fP section\&.
The program described here is a fast threaded implementation written by the
algorithm\&'s creator with contributions by several others\&. Anton Enright
co-implemented threading; see the \fBHISTORY/CREDITS\fP section for a complete
account\&.
See the \fBAPPLICABILITY\fP section for a description of the type of
graph mcl likes best, and for a qualitative assessment of its speed\&.
\fBmcl\fP is accompanied by several other utilities for analyzing clusterings and
performing matrix and graph operations; see the \fBSEE ALSO\fP section\&.

The first argument is the input file name,
or a single hyphen to read from stdin\&. The rationale for
making the name of the input file a fixed parameter is that you typically do
several runs with different parameters\&. In command line mode it is
pleasant if you do not have to skip over an immutable parameter all the
time\&.

The \fB-I\fP\ \&\fIf\fP option is the main control,
affecting cluster granularity\&. Using \fBmcl\fP is as simple as
typing (assuming a file \fIproteins\fP contains a matrix/graph
in native matrix format)

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
mcl proteins -I 2\&.0
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

The above will result in a clustering written to the file
named \fIout\&.proteins\&.I20s2\fP\&. It is - of course -
possible to explicitly specify the name of the output file
using the \fB-o\fP\ \&\fIfname\fP option\&. Refer to the
\fB-ap\fP option for a description of mcl\&'s procedure
in automatically constructing file names from it parameters\&.

In native mode clusterings are stored as matrices
- this is discussed in the \fBmcxio(5)\fP section\&.
You presumably want to convert the output to something that
is easier to interpret\&. The native mcl matrix format is perhaps
unpleasant to parse in the quick and dirty way\&. You can use

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
mcl proteins -I 2\&.0 -use-tab proteins\&.tab --yield-abc
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

to get a line/tab based output format,
each line containing a cluster in the form of tab-separated labels\&.
Here \fBproteins\&.tab\fP should be a tab file previously
created by \fBmcxdeblast(1)\fP or mcl\&.
Refer to \fBmcxio(5)\fP for more information on tab files,
and the entries grouped under \fB--abc\fP for an extensive
discussion of the various ways in which mcl can combine
label format and matrix format in input and output\&.

In finding good \fBmcl\fP parameter settings for a particular domain,
or in finding cluster structure at different levels of granularity,
one typically runs mcl multiple times for varying values of f (refer
to the \fB-I\fP\ \&\fIinflation\fP option for further information)\&.

\fBNOTE\fP
.br
mcl interprets the matrix
entries or graph edge weights as \fBsimilarities\fP, and it likes
\fBundirected input graphs\fP best\&. It can handle directed graphs, but any
node pair (i,j) for which w(i,j) is much smaller than w(j,i) or vice versa
will presumably have a slightly negative effect on the clusterings output by
mcl\&. Many such node pairs will have a distinctly negative effect, so try to
make your input graphs undirected\&. How your edge weights are computed may
affect mcl\&'s performance\&. In protein clustering, one way to go is to
choose the negated logarithm of the BLAST probabilities (see
\fBREFERENCES\fP)\&.

\fBmcl\fP\&'s default parameters should make it quite fast under almost all
circumstances\&. Taking default parameters, mcl has been used to generate
good protein clusters on 133k proteins, taking 10 minutes running time on a
Compaq ES40 system with four alpha EV6\&.7 processors\&. It has been applied
(with good results) to graphs with 800k nodes, and if you have the memory
(and preferably CPUs as well) nothing should stop you from going further\&.

For large graphs, there are several groups of parameters available for
tuning the mcl computing process, should it be necessary\&. The easiest thing
to do is just vary the \fB-scheme\fP option\&. This
triggers different settings for the group of pruning parameters
\fB-p/-P\fP, \fB-R\fP, \fB-S\fP, and
\fB-pct\fP\&. The default setting corresponds with
\fB-scheme\fP\ \&\fB6\fP\&.
When doing multiple mcl runs for the same graphs with different
\fB-I\fP settings (for obtaining clusterings at different levels
of granularity), it can be useful to factor out the first bit
of computation that is common to all runs, by using
the \fB-write-expanded\fP option one time
and then using \fB-if\fP\ \&\fIinflation\fP for each run in the set\&.
Whether mcl considers a graph large depends mainly on the graph
connectivity; a highly connected graph on 50,000 nodes is large to
mcl (so that you might want to tune resources) whereas a sparsely
connected graph on 500,000 nodes may be business as usual\&.

\fBmcl\fP is a memory munger\&. Its precise appetite depends on the resource
settings\&. You can get a rough (and usually much too pessimistic) upper
bound for the amount of RAM that is needed by using the
\fB-how-much-ram\fP option\&. The corresponding
entry in this manual page contains the simple formula via which the upper
bound is computed\&.

Other options of interest are the option to specify threads
\fB-te\fP, and the verbosity-related options
\fB-v\fP and \fB-V\fP\&.
The actual settings are shown with \fB-z\fP, and for graphs with
at most 12 nodes or so you can view the MCL matrix iterands on screen
by supplying \fB--show\fP (this may give some
more feeling)\&.

MCL iterands allow a generic interpretation as clusterings as well\&. The
clusterings associated with early iterands may contain a fair amount of
overlap\&. Refer to the \fB-dump\fP option, the \fBmclfaq(7)\fP
manual, and the \fBclm imac\fP utility (Interpret Matrices As Clusterings)\&.
Use \fBclm imac\fP only if you have a special reason; the normal usage of \fBmcl\fP is
to do multiple runs for varying \fB-I\fP parameters and use the
clusterings output by mcl itself\&.

Under very rare circumstances, \fBmcl\fP might get stuck in a seemingly infinite
loop\&. If the number of iterations exceeds a hundred and the \fIchaos\fP
indicator remains nearly constant (presumably around value 0\&.37), you can
force mcl to stop by sending it the ALRM signal (usually done
by \fBkill -s ALRM\fP \fIpid\fP)\&. It will finish the current
iteration, and interpret the last iterand as a clustering\&. Alternatively, you
can wait and mcl might converge by itself or it will certainly stop after
10,000 iterations (the default value for the \fB-L\fP option)\&. The
most probable explanation for such an infinite loop is that the input graph
contains the flip-flop graph of node size three as a subgraph\&.

The creator of this page feels that manual pages are a valuable resource,
that online html documentation is also a good thing to have, and
that info pages are way \fIway\fP ahead of their time\&. The
\fBNOTES\fP section explains how this page was created\&.

In the \fBOPTIONS\fP section options are listed in order of
importance, with related options grouped together\&.
.SH OPTIONS

.ZI 3m "\fB-I\fP f (\fIinflation\fP)"
\&
.br
Sets the main inflation value to f\&. This value is the main handle
for affecting cluster granularity\&. It is usually chosen somewhere
in the range [1\&.2-5\&.0]\&. \fB-I\fP\ \&\fB5\&.0\fP will tend to result
in fine-grained clusterings, and \fB-I\fP\ \&\fB1\&.2\fP will tend to
result in very coarse grained clusterings\&. Your mileage will vary
depending on the characteristics of your data\&. That is why it is
a good idea to test the quality and coherency of your clusterings
using \fBclm dist\fP and \fBclm info\fP\&. This will most likely reveal that
certain values of \fB-I\fP are simply not right for your data\&. The
\fBclm dist\fP section contains a discussion of how to use the cluster
validation tools shipped with \fBmcl\fP (see the \fBSEE ALSO\fP section)\&.

With low values for \fB-I\fP, like \fB-I\fP\ \&\fB1\&.2\fP, you should be
prepared to use more resources in order to maintain quality of
clusterings, i\&.e\&. increase the argument to the
\fB-scheme\fP option\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-o\fP str (\fIfname\fP)"
\&
.br
Output the clustering to file named fname\&. It is possible to send the
clustering to stdout by supplying \fB-o\fP\ \&\fB-\fP\&. If either one of
\fB--abc\fP, \fB--yield-abc\fP, or
\fB-use-tab\fP\ \&\fItab-file\fP is used the output will be in label format \-
provided a tab file is specified or the input is in label format\&. Otherwise
the clustering is output in the mcl matrix format; see the \fBmcxio(5)\fP
section for more information on this\&. Refer also to the group of options
discussed at \fB--abc\fP\&.

Look at the \fB-ap\fP\ \&\fIprefix\fP option and its siblings for the
automatic naming constructions employed by \fBmcl\fP if the \fB-o\fP option is
not used\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-od\fP <dir> (\fIdirectory\fP)"
\&
.br
Specify the directory where to output clusterings\&. This is useful
when you let mcl automatically construct the output file name,
but want the clustering in a directory different from the
one where the input graph resides\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-shadow\fP mode (\fIapply shadowing\fP)"
\&
'in -3m
.ZI 3m "\fB-shadow-s\fP <num> (\fIboost factor (experimental)\fP)"
\&
'in -3m
.ZI 3m "\fB--shadow-vl\fP (\fIshadow distant nodes\fP)"
\&
'in -3m
'in +3m
\&
.br

\fBEXPERIMENTAL\fP
.br
\fIThese options are intended and useful for hierarchical
clustering with\fP \fBmclcm(1)\fP\&.
\fB--shadow-vl\fP is the same as \fB-shadow\fP\ \&\fBvl\fP
and is at present the best mode to choose\&.

Use these to weaken the connectivity of certain
classes of nodes\&. This means that the effect of the edges
in which they participate on the final clustering result is diminished\&.
This is done such that the extent to which a node exhibits certain
characteristics is correlated with the extent to which its connectivity is
weakened\&. The different types of characteristics that can be regulated
are

.ZI 3m "\fBvl\fP"
value low - nodes for which the average value of its edges
is low compared with the same number across its neighbours\&.
.in -3m
.ZI 3m "\fBvh\fP"
value high - nodes for which the average value of its edges
is high compared with the same number across its neighbours\&.
.in -3m
.ZI 3m "\fBel\fP"
edge low - nodes for which the number of neighbours
is low compared with the same number across its neighbours\&.
.in -3m
.ZI 3m "\fBeh\fP"
edge high - nodes for which the number of neighbours
is high compared with the same number across its neighbours\&.
.in -3m
The characteristics above, e\&.g\&. \fBvl\fP, correspond to the modes
that can be passed to the \fB-shadow\fP argument\&. The first mode \fBvl\fP
is the one most likely to be useful\&. Combining different modes is possible
but may lead to unbalanced clusterings\&. Using the mode \fBel\fP in \fBmclcm\fP
may similarly lead to unbalanced hierachies\&.

The boost factor can be set e\&.g\&. to 2\&.0 to increase the effect of shadowing\&.
The default setting is 1\&.0\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-c\fP <num> (\fIreweight loops\fP)"
\&
.br
As the final step of loop computation (i\&.e\&. after initialization
and shadowing), all loop weights are multiplied by \fB<num>\fP,

These items all relate to label input and/or label output\&.
\fB--abc\fP tells mcl to expect label input and output clusters
in terms of those labels\&.
It is equivalent to the combination of \fB--expect-abc\fP
and \fB--yield-abc\fP\&.

\fB-restrict-tab\fP and \fB-strict-tab\fP
can be used both with label input and native format\&.
When label input is used, they restrict, respectively require
labels to be present in the tab file\&.
When native input is used they restrict, respectively require
indices to be present in the tab domain\&.
\fB-strict-tab\fP fails in the face of exceptions, \fB-restrict-tab\fP
will simply ignore them\&.
\fB-strict-tab\fP and \fB-restrict-tab\fP do \fInot\fP
automatically yield label output\&. You need \fB--abc\fP or
\fB--yield-abc\fP\&.

\fB-extend-tab\fP is only useful when label input is used\&.
It will create a new label/index mapping when a label is not found
in the tab file\&. Presumably you want to use the \fB-write-tab\fP
as well then\&.

\fB-use-tab\fP is only useful when matrix input is used\&.
It will use the tab file to convert the output to labels; it does
not hitch on indices missing from the tab file\&. Take a pick
from \fB-restrict-tab\fP or \fB-strict-tab\fP \fIand\fP
\fB--abc\fP or \fB--yield-abc\fP if that is what you want\&.

\fB-write-tab\fP can be used to preserve the tab file
that was constructed from label input, either from scratch
or by extension from a previous tab file in case \fB-extend-tab\fP
was used\&.

in all its dealings with tab files, mcl will only accept those

domains for which the indices range from zero to some number \fCN\fP

but it requires mcxdump to act as an intermediary -
\fBmcxdump(1)\fP has no such limitations\&. This need in

If you work with label input, \fB-write-graph\fP can be

\fB-write-graphx\fP is similar except that it applies to the graph after

\fB-tf\fP option)\&. In a following mcl invocation, you can use this
graph rather than the label input\&. This should greatly speed up matters\&.
Presumably the first time around you have use the
\fB-write-tab\fP\ \&\fImy\&.tab\fP option\&. You can put that \fCmy\&.tab\fP file to

The \fB--write-binary\fP option is useful for large graphs as it
will drastically speed up subsequent load times\&. Otherwise it
is not necessary, and bear in mind that binary format is not
portable across machines and it is not garantueed to be portable
across different version of mcl\&.
For very large graphs it could be a bit wasteful to load a large tab
structure into memory\&. The second line can then be replaced by

Admittedly this is beginning to look like black magic, but truthfully
it is not\&. \fBmcxdump(1)\fP
simply needs to be told how it should format its output\&. It needs to know
it should dump the matrix columns (clusters in this case) on a per-line
basis, that it should not dump the index that identifies the cluster
(an arbitrary rank in our case), and that there is no need to output values\&.
\fBmcxdump\fP furthermore does not know how the tab file relates to
its input matrix, whereas mcl previously had the advantage of knowing\&.
Hence \fB-tabr\fP is telling mcxdump that the \fIrow domain\fP
in the clustering matrix identify the nodes\&.

The first step in almost any mcl run is that the matrix constructed from the
input is \fIsquared\fP or \fIexpanded\fP\&. This is a rather costly operation
if the input size is large\&. When you are doing multiple runs it can thus be
useful to cache the expanded matrix at the cost of a little more hassle\&.
Use \fB-write-expanded\fP\ \&\fIfname\fP to write this matrix to \fIfname\fP\&.
In subsequent runs supply \fIfname\fP as the input argument to mcl and
use \fB-if\fP\ \&\fInum\fP to indicate that the first thing to apply should be
inflation with parameter \fInum\fP\&. Combining our previous two
examples then yields

\&
.br
There are currently seven different resource schemes, indexed 1\&.\&.7\&.
High schemes result in more expensive computations that may possibly be
more accurate\&. The default scheme is 4\&. When \fBmcl\fP is done, it will give a
grade (the so called \fIjury synopsis\fP) to the appropriateness of the
scheme used\&. \fIA low grade does not necessarily imply that the
resulting clustering is bad\fP - but anyway, a low grade should be reason
to try for a higher scheme\&. The grades are listed in the
\fBPRUNING OPTIONS\fP section under the
\fB-nj\fP option\&.

The \fBPRUNING OPTIONS\fP section contains an elaborate description
of the way \fBmcl\fP manages resources, should you be interested\&.
In case you are worried about the validation of the resulting
clusterings, the \fBmclfaq(7)\fP section
has several entries discussing this issue\&. The bottom line is
that you have to compare the clusterings resulting from different
schemes (and otherwise identical parameters) using utilities
such as \fBclm dist\fP, \fBclm info\fP on the one hand, and your
own sound judgment on the other hand\&.

If your input graph is extremely dense, with an average node degree
(i\&.e\&. the number of neighbours per node) that is somewhere above
500, you may need to filter the input graph by removing the nodes
of highest degree (and projecting them back onto the resulting
clustering afterwards) or by using the
\fB-pp\fP option\&.

These options will result in postprocessing on the clustering, reallocating
nodes that seems to have siphoned the wrong way\&. The input matrix will be
reread for this\&.

When applied to networks with inhomogenously distributed edge density
characteristics the mcl process will sometimes cause smaller
clusters/sparse areas to suck in border nodes which 1) have only few
edges to that cluster/area and 2) seem to have been sucked out of a much
denser cluster into which they would fit beautifully\&. This is fully in line
with the flow characteristics of mcl but a largely unwanted phenomenon\&. The
postprocessing step was added as a remedy for this problem should it
manifest itself\&. It is based on the efficiency criterion described in
[1] and [5] (there called \fIcoverage\fP)\&.

With \fB-lint-l\fP a node is tentatively reallocated if this will improve
its effiency, and if it is initially in a cluster of size at most \fInuml\fP\&.
After all nodes that are candidate for reallocation have been
identified the proposed new clustering is accepted if it increases the total
edge weight captured\&. This procedure is iterated until no further
reallocations are possible\&. The efficiency measure is a conservative
criterion in that it does not unduly favour larger clusters over smaller
clusters\&. For example, if a node has 4 neighbours in a cluster of size 8 and
it has a further 8 neighbours in a cluster of size 100 the efficiency for
the first cluster (relative to that node) will generally be higher than the
efficiency for the second cluster\&.

With \fB-lint-k\fP clusters up to the given size \fInumk\fP
are assimilated by a larger cluster if a suitable candidate is found\&.
This is based on the same criteria as described above, except
that a cluster is absorbed in its entirety\&.

Inflation is adapted depending on the amount of local dispersion,

If the \fB-o\fP\ \&\fIfname\fP option is not used,
\fBmcl\fP will create a file name (for writing output to) that
should uniquely characterize the important parameters used in the
current invocation of mcl\&. The default format is \fBout\&.fname\&.suf\fP,
where \fBout\fP is simply the literal string \fCout\fP, \fBfname\fP is the
first argument containing the name of the file (with the graph) to be
clustered, and where \fBsuf\fP is the suffix encoding a set of parameters
(described further below)\&.

The \fB-ap\fP\ \&\fIstr\fP option specifies a prefix to use
rather than \fBout\&.fname\fP as sketched above\&.
However, \fBmcl\fP will interpret the character \&'=\&', if present
in \fIstr\fP, as a placeholder for the input file name\&.

If the \fB-aa\fP\ \&\fIstr\fP option is used, \fBmcl\fP will append
\fBstr\fP to the suffix \fBsuf\fP created by itself\&.
You can use this if you need to encode some extra information in the
file name suffix\&.

The suffix is constructed as follows\&. The \fB-I\fP\ \&\fIf\fP
and \fB-scheme\fP parameter are always encoded\&.
The \fB-pi\fP\ \&\fIf\fP, \fB-l\fP\ \&\fIk\fP, and \fB-i\fP\ \&\fIf\fP

is encoded using \fIexactly one\fP trailing digit behind the decimal
separator (which itself is not written)\&. The setting \fB-I\fP\ \&\fB3\&.14\fP

These clusters are obtained from a particular directed acyclic graph

three digits precision (behind the comma), and of size up to 14(x14)
with two digits\&. This can give you an idea of how \fBmcl\fP operates,

come first, if the mode is \&'lex\&', clusters are ordered

.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-overlap\fP str (\fIoverlap mode\fP)"
\&
.br
Mode \fIkeep\fP causes mcl to retain overlap
should this improbable event occur\&. In theory, \fBmcl\fP may generate a
clustering that contains overlap, although this almost never happens
in practice, as it requires some particular type of symmetry to be present
in the input graph (not just any symmetry will do)\&. Mathematically
speaking, this is a conjecture and not a theorem, but the present author wil
eat his shoe if it fails to be true (for marzipan values of shoe)\&. It is
easy though to construct an input graph for which certain mcl settings
result in overlap - for example a line graph on an odd number of nodes\&. The
default is to remove overlap should it occur, corresponding with mode
\fIremove\fP\&.

In mode \fIsplit\fP mcl will put all nodes in overlap into
separate clusters\&. These clusters are chosen such that
two nodes are put in the same new cluster if and only if
they always occur paired in the clusters of the
overlapping clustering\&.

This option has more than theoretical use because \fBmcl\fP is able
to generate clusterings associated with intermediate iterands\&.
For these clusterings, overlap is more than a theoretical
possibility, and will often occur\&. If you specify
the \fB-L\fP\ \&\fIk\fP option, mcl will output the
clustering associated with the last iterand computed, and
it may well contain overlap\&.

This option has no effect on the clusterings that are
output when using \fB-dump\fP\ \&\fIcls\fP -
the default for those is that overlap is not touched,
and this default can not yet be overridden\&.

After computing a new (column stochastic) matrix vector during expansion
(which is matrix multiplication c\&.q\&. squaring), the vector is
successively exposed to different pruning strategies\&. The intent of
pruning is that many small entries are removed while retaining much of
the stochastic mass of the original vector\&. After pruning, vectors are
rescaled to be stochastic again\&. MCL iterands are theoretically known to
be sparse in a weighted sense, and this manoever effectively perturbs the
MCL process a little in order to obtain matrices that are genuinely
sparse, thus keeping the computation tractable\&. An example of monitoring
pruning can be found in the discussion of
\fB-v\fP\ \&\fBpruning\fP
at the end of this section\&.

\fBmcl\fP proceeds as follows\&. First, entries that are smaller than
\fIcutoff\fP are removed, resulting in a vector with at most
\fI1/cutoff\fP entries\&. The cutoff can be supplied either by
\fB-p\fP, or as the inverse value by \fB-P\fP\&. The latter is more
intuitive, if your intuition is like mine (and the P stands for precision
or pruning by the way)\&.
The cutoff just described is rigid; it is the same for all vectors\&. The
\fB--adapt\fP option causes the computation of a
cutoff that depends on a vector\&'s homogeneity properties, and this option
may or may not speed up mcl\&.

Second, if the remaining stochastic mass (i\&.e\&. the sum of all remaining
entries) is less than \fIpct\fP/100 and the number of remaining
entries is less than \fIr\fP (as specified by the \fB-R\fP flag),
\fBmcl\fP will try to regain ground by recovering the largest discarded
entries\&. The total number of entries is not allowed to grow larger than
\fIr\fP\&.
If recovery was not necessary, mcl tries to prune the vector further
down to at most \fIs\fP entries (if applicable), as specified by the
\fB-S\fP flag\&. If this results in a vector that satisfies the recovery
condition then recovery is attempted, exactly as described above\&. The
latter will not occur of course if \fIr\fP <= \fIs\fP\&.

The default setting is something like \fB-P\fP\ \&\fB4000\fP \fB-S\fP\ \&\fB500\fP
\fB-R\fP\ \&\fB600\fP\&. Check the \fB-z\fP flag to be sure\&. There is a set
of precomposed settings, which can be triggered with the
\fB-scheme\fP\ \&\fIk\fP option\&. \fIk\fP=4 is the default
scheme; higher values for \fIk\fP result in costlier and more accurate
computations (vice versa for lower, cheaper, and less accurate)\&.
The schemes are listed using the \fB--show-schemes\fP option\&. It is
advisable to use the \fB-scheme\fP option only in interactive mode,
and to use the explicit expressions when doing batch processing\&. The
reason is that there is \fIno guarantee whatsoever\fP that the schemes
will not change between different releases\&. This is because the scheme
options should reflect good general purpose settings, and it may become
appararent that other schemes are better\&.

Note that \&'less accurate\&' or \&'more accurate\&' computations may still
generate the same output clusterings\&. Use \fBclm dist\fP to compare output
clusterings for different resource parameters\&. Refer to \fBclm dist\fP
for a discussion of this issue\&.

The \fB-my-scheme\fP\ \&\fBn\fP option sets a tag that is used in constructing
the default output naming file\&. If not used, \fBmcl\fP will create
a relatively long string describing the settings of the
\fB-P\fP, \fB-pct\fP, \fB-R\fP, and \fB-S\fP parameters,
e\&.g\&. \fBP600Q85R1000S1200\fP (where \fBQ\fP tags the \fIpct\fP setting)\&.
If used, mcl will simply use the tag \fBs\fP\fIn\fP\&.

\&
.br
The two options \fB-warn-pct\fP and \fB-warn-factor\fP relate to
warnings that may be triggered once the \fIinitial\fP pruning of a vector
is completed\&. The idea is to issue warnings if initial pruning almost
completely destroys a computed vector, as this may be a sign that the
pruning parameters should be changed\&. It depends on the mass remaining
after initial pruning whether a warning will be issued\&. If that mass is
less than \fIwarn-pct\fP or if the number of remaining entries is smaller
by a factor \fIwarn-factor\fP than both the number of entries originally
computed \fIand\fP the recovery number, in that case, \fBmcl\fP will issue a
warning\&.

\fB-warn-pct\fP takes an integer between 0 and 100 as parameter,
\fB-warn-factor\fP takes a real positive number\&. They default to
something like 30 and 50\&.0\&. If you want to see less warnings, decrease
\fIwarn-pct\fP and increase \fIwarn-factor\fP\&. Set \fIwarn-factor\fP to zero
if you want no warnings\&.

\fBSelection and recovery\fP

The number of selections and recoveries \fBmcl\fP had to perform during each

The distribution of the vector footprints (i\&.e\&. the number of nonzero

This particular output was generated (and truncated after three rounds of

\fB-R\fP\ \&\fB600\fP, and \fB-pct\fP\ \&\fB95\fP\&.

The header entries 8532c85\&.\&. indicate thresholds going from 80000, 50000,
20000, 12500, 8000, all the way down to 300, 200, and 125\&. The character \&'c\&'
signifies the base 1\&.25 (for no apparent reason)\&. The second entry \&'2\&'
(after \&'0\&') on the first line signifies that roughly 20 percent of all the
vectors had a footprint (#nonzero entries) in excess of 800 entries\&.
Likewise, 40 percent had a footprint in excess of 300 entries\&. The \&'0\&'
entries signify a fraction somewhere below 5 percent, and the \&'@\&' entries
signify a fraction somewhere above 95 percent\&.

Two columns are listed, one for the expansion vector footprints
(i\&.e\&. after squaring), and the other for the vector
footprints \fIright after initial pruning took place\fP (i\&.e\&. before
selection and recovery, after either adaptive or rigid pruning)\&.
This may give an idea of the soundness of the initial pruning
process (overly severe, or overly mild), and the extent
to which you want to apply selection and/or recovery\&.

\fBInitial and final mass windows\fP
.br
The mass averages of the pruned vectors after the first selection
stage are shown, and the mass averages of the vectors as \fIfinally
computed\fP, i\&.e\&. after selection and recovery\&. Note that the latter
corresponds to a different stage than what is shown for the vector
footprints, if either selection or recovery is turned on\&.
For both cases, three averages are shown: the average over all vectors,
the average over the worst x cases, and the average over the worst y
cases\&. The mass averages are shown as percentages: \&'98\&' on the first
line under the \&'prune/all\&' column means that overall 98 percent of the
stochastic mass of the matrix was kept after pruning\&.

This example demonstrates that many entries could be
removed while retaining much of the stochastic mass\&. The effect of the
recovery (\fB-R\fP) parameter is also clear: the final averages are
higher than the initial averages, as a result of \fBmcl\fP undoing some
overenthousiastic pruning\&.

An average over the worst k cases is called a window of width k;
internally, \fBmcl\fP tracks many more such windows\&. The result of this can
be seen when using the \fB--append-log\fP=\fBy\fP option
(which appends a log to the cluster output) or the
\fB--show-log\fP=\fBy\fP option
(which sends the log to STDOUT)\&.
From a fixed set of windows those that are applicable are tracked, that
is, all those windows for which the width does not exceed the graph
cardinality\&. The windows in the fixed set have respective sizes 1, 2, 5,
10, 20, 50, and so on up until 5000000 (which makes 15 windows in all)\&.

.SH PIPELINES

As of the 1\&.006 release, label data can be directly streamed into
MCL as described in \fBGETTING STARTED\fP and \fBEXAMPLES\fP\&.
For BLAST input this is achieved
by hooking up \fBmcxdeblast(1)\fP \fB--abc-out\fP=\fI-\fP with
\fBmcl\fP - \fB--abc\fP\&. Refer to \fBGETTING STARTED\fP for examples\&.

The classic mode of operation is more heavyweight, and the remainder
of this section describes the underlying design\&.
Much of the code now used for streaming directly into mcl was
derived from this earlier framework\&.

In general, clustering requires several stages; creating the matrix,
running mcl, and displaying the result\&. The display stage is supported
by \fBclm format\fP\&. The matrix creation stage often needs only be
done once for a given data collection, followed by repeated runs of
the other two stages for varying inflation values and scheme settings\&.

The matrix creation stage can often be split up in two more stages,
namely parsing a data file in some given format, and assembling a
matrix from the data bits and pieces, such as node indices and edge
weights or even edge weight contributions\&.
The assembly step can be done by \fBmcxassemble(1)\fP,
which allows a very general input format and customizable behaviour
in how the bits and pieces should be transformed to the input graph\&.
This leaves the parse stage to be filled in\&.

The \fBmclpipeline script\fP implements a generic and
customizable pipeline encapsulating the four stages distinguished
here (parsing, assembly, clustering, display)\&. It is possible to
let only part of the pipeline be active, and many other features are
supported\&. The IO mechanism is entirely file based, and files are
associated with parametrizations via file name extensions (by all
means a simple mechanism)\&.

\fBmclpipeline(1)\fP requires a single parse script to be specified\&.
It will be plugged into the pipeline and you should be set to run\&.
The parse script must satisfy the interface requirements described
in the \fBmclpipeline manual page\fP\&.

For BLAST input, the \fBmclblastline script\fP
provides a dedicated mclpipeline interface\&. It uses the
\fBmcxdeblast script\fP that comes prepackaged with mcl\&.

A few things to note\&. First, MCL will symmetrize any
arrow it finds\&. If it sees \fCbat cat 1\&.0\fP it will act as if it also
saw \fCcat bat 1\&.0\fP\&. You can explicitly specify \fCcat bat 1\&.0\fP,
mcl will in the first parse stage simply end up with duplicate
entries\&. Second, MCL deduplicates repeated edges by taking the
one with the maximum value\&. So,

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
---8<------8<------8<------8<------8<---
cat hat  0\&.2

with value 0\&.8\&.
.SH APPLICABILITY

\fBmcl\fP will work very well for graphs in which the diameter of the natural
clusters is not too large\&. The presence of many edges between different
clusters is not problematic; as long as there is cluster structure, mcl
will find it\&. It is less likely to work well for graphs with clusters
(inducing subgraphs) of large diameter, e\&.g\&. grid-like graphs derived from
Euclidean data\&. So mcl in its canonical form is certainly not fit for
boundary detection or image segmentation\&. I experimented with a modified
mcl and boundary detection in the thesis pointed to below (see
\fBREFERENCES\fP)\&. This was fun and not entirely unsuccesful, but not
something to be pursued further\&.

\fBmcl\fP likes \fIundirected input graphs best\fP, and it really dislikes graphs
with node pairs (i,j) for which an arc going from i to j is present and the
counter-arc from j to i is absent\&. Try to make your input graph undirected\&.
Furthermore, mcl interprets edge weights in graphs as similarities\&. If you
are used to working with dissimilarities, you will have to convert those to
similarities using some conversion formula\&. The most important thing is
that you feel confident that the similarities are reasonable, i\&.e\&. if X is
similar to Y with weight 2, and X is similar to Z with weight 200, then this
should mean that the similarity of Y (to X) is neglectible compared with the
similarity of Z (to X)\&.

\fBmcl\fP is probably not suited for clustering \fItree graphs\fP\&. This is because
mcl works best if there are multiple paths between different nodes in the
natural clusters, but in tree graphs there is only one path between any pair
of nodes\&. Trees are too sparse a structure for mcl to work on\&.

\fBmcl\fP may well be suited for clustering \fIlattices\fP\&. It will depend
on the density characteristics of the lattice, and the conditions for
success are the same as those for clustering graphs in general: The
diameter of the natural clusters should not be too large\&.
\fBNOTE\fP when clustering a lattice, you \fIhave\fP to cluster
the underlying undirected graph, and not the directed graph that represents
the lattice itself\&. The reason is that one has to allow mcl (or any other
cluster algorithm) to \&'look back in time\&', so to speak\&. Clustering and
directionality bite each other (long discussion omitted)\&.

\fBmcl\fP has a worst-case time complexity O(N*k^2), where N is the number of
nodes in the graph, and k is the maximum number of neighbours tracked during
computations\&. k depends on the \fB-P\fP and \fB-S\fP options\&. If the
\fB-S\fP option is used (which is the default setting) then k equals the
value corresponding with this option\&. Typical values for k are in the range
500\&.\&.1000\&. The average case is much better than the worst case though, as
cluster structure itself has the effect of helping mcl\&'s pruning schemes,
certainly if the diameter of natural clusters is not large\&.

If matrices are output in interchange format, by default empty vectors
will not be listed\&. Equivalently (during input time),
vectors for which no listing is present are understood to be empty -
note that the \fIpresence\fP of a vector is established using
the domain information found in the header part\&.
It is possible to enforce listing of empty vectors by
setting bit \&'1\&' in the variable MCLXICFLAGS\&.

MCL and its sibling applications will always check a matrix for consistency
while it is being read\&. If this variable is set, the consistency check is
omitted\&. For large graphs the speed up can be considerable\&. However, if the
input graph is not conforming it will likely crash the application that
is using it\&.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

If \fBmcl\fP issues a diagnostic error, it will most likely be
because the input matrix could not be parsed succesfully\&.
\fBmcl\fP tries to be helpful in describing the kind of parse error\&.
The mcl matrix format is described in the \fBmcxio(5)\fP section\&.

.SH HISTORY/CREDITS

The MCL algorithm was conceived in spring 1996 by the present author\&.
The first implementation of the MCL algorithm followed that spring
and summer\&. It was written in Perl and proved the viability of
the algorithm\&. The implementation described here began its life in
autumn 1997\&. The first versions of the vital matrix library
were designed jointly by Stijn van Dongen and Annius Groenink in
the period Oktober 1997 - May 1999\&. The efficient matrix-vector
multiplication routine was written by Annius\&. This routine is
without significant changes still one of the cornerstones of this
MCL implementation\&.

Since May 1999 all MCL libraries have seen much development and
redesign by the present author\&. Matrix-matrix multiplication has been
rewritten several times to take full advantage of the sparseness
properties of the stochastic matrices brought forth by the MCL
algorithm\&. This mostly concerns the issue of pruning \- removal of
small elements in a stochastic column in order to keep matrices
sparse\&.

Very instructive was that around April 2001 Rob Koopman pointed out
that selecting the k largest elements out of a collection of n is
best done using a min-heap\&. This was the key to the second major
rewrite (now counting three) of the MCL pruning schemes, resulting in
much faster code, generally producing a more accurate computation of
the MCL process\&.

In May 2001 Anton Enright initiated the parallellization of the
\fBmcl\fP code and threaded inflation\&. From this example, Stijn threaded
expansion\&. This was great, as the MCL data structures and operands
(normal matrix multiplication and Hadamard multiplication) just beg
for parallellization\&.

Onwards\&.
The January 2003 03-010 release introduced support for sparsely
enumerated (i\&.e\&. indices need not be sequential) graphs and matrices, the
result of a major overhaul of the matrix library and most higher layers\&.
Conceptually, the library now sees matrices as infinite quadrants
of which only finite subsections happen to have nonzero entries\&.

The June 2003 03-154 release introduced unix-type pipelines for clustering,
including the BLAST parser mcxdeblast and the mclblastline script\&.
The April 2004 04-105 release revived binary format, which has been a first
class citizen every since\&.

With the March 2005 05-090 release mcxsubs finally acquired a sane
specification syntax\&. The November 2005 05-314 release brought the ability
to stream label input directly into mcl\&. The subsequent release introduced a
transformation language shared by various mcl siblings that allows arbitrary
progressions of transformations to be applied to either stream values or
matrix values\&.

Joost van Baal set up the mcl CVS tree and packaged mcl for Debian
GNU/Linux\&. He completely autotooled the sources, so much so that at first I
found it hard to find them back amidst bootstrap, aclocal\&.m4, depcomp, and
other beauties\&.

Jan van der Steen shared his elegant mempool code\&. Philip Lijnzaad gave
useful comments\&. Philip, Shawn Hoon, Abel Ureta-Vidal,
and Martin Mokrejs sent helpful bug reports\&.

Abel Ureta-Vidal and Dinakarpandian Deendayal commented on
and contributed to mcxdeblast and mcxassemble\&.

Tim Hughes contributed several good bug reports for mcxassemble,
mcxdeblast and zoem (a workhorse for \fBclm format\fP)\&.
