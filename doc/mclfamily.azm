\NAME{mclfamily}{a description of the mcl family of cluster applications.}

\par
   \mcl is the Amsterdam implementation of the Markov Cluster Algorithm.
   It is described in the \sibref{mcl}{mcl manual}.
   Several other utilities are part of the MCL distribution. This manual pages
   gives an overview.
\: A short overview is found in
\: \sibidx\${html}{, with links to their manual page}. This manual page
\: provides somewhat longer descriptions and points out various ways
\: of gaining insight, evaluating results, and implementing sanity checks,
\: using these utilities.

\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}

\par{
   \sib{mcl} - the clustering program. Since the 05-314 release
   it has the ability to read in and cluster label input.}

\par{
   \sibmclfaq - Frequently Asked Questions.}

\par{
   \sibmcxio - a description of the mcl matrix format.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxconvert} - convert matrices from ascii mcl format to
   binary mcl format or vice versa.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxassemble} - assemble a matrix/graph from partial edge
   weight scores. Useful intermediate format to be used when transforming
   application specific data into an mcl input matrix.
   However, \mcl has now acquired the ability to read graphs directly
   from label input, removing the need for \mcxassemble in most cases.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxdump} - dump matrices in a line-based format, optionally map
   indices to labels.  Either a node pair (matrix entry) or a node list
   (matrix row) is output per line.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxload} - load matrices and tab files
   from a line-based ID1 ID2 format.
   It can load bipartite structures in which the two columns
   contain labels from different domains. It has many options
   to further symmetrize and transform the input.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxarray} - transform array data to MCL matrices. The data
   may be of rectangular \v{M\~x\~N} type. Either an \v{M\~x\~M}
   or an \v{N\~x\~N} dimensional matrix can be made, by computing
   correlation scores between the vectors in one of the to domains.
   The Pearson correlation coefficient and the cosine are supported,
   and further tearing and pruning options can be applied.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxmap} - relabel indices in a graph.}

\par{
   \sib{mcx} - an interpreter for a stack language that enables
   interaction with the \mcl matrix libraries.  It can be used both from the
   command line and interactively, and supports a rich set of operations such
   as transposition, scaling, column scaling, multiplication, Hadamard powers
   and products, et cetera. The general aim is to provide handles for simple
   number and matrix arithmetic,
   and for graph, set, and clustering operations.  The following is
   a very simple example of implementing and using \mcl in this language.}

\verbatim{\:/
 2.0 .i def                    # define inflation value.
 /small lm                     # load matrix in file 'small'.
 dim id add                    # add identity matrix.
 st .x def                     # make stochastic, bind to x.
 { xpn .i infl vm } .mcl def   # define one mcl iteration.
 20 .x .mcl repeat             # iterate  20 times
 imac                          # interpret matrix as clustering.
 vm                            # view matrix (clustering).}

\car{
   One of the more interesting things that can be done is doing mcl runs
   with more complicated inflation profiles than the two-constant approach used
   in \mcl itself.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxsubs} - compute a submatrix of a given matrix, where row
   and column index sets can be specified as lists of indices combined
   with list of clusters in a given clustering. Useful for inspecting
   local cluster structure.}

\par{
   \sib{clmdist} - compute the split/join distance between two 
   partitions. The split/join distance is better suited for measuring partition
   similarity than the long-known equivalence mismatch coefficient. The former
   measures the number of node moves required to transform one partition into
   the other, the latter measures differences between volumes of edges of
   unions of complete graphs associated with partitions.}

\par{
   \sib{clminfo} - compute a performance measure saying how well
   a clustering captures the edge weights of the input graph. Useful
   for comparing different clusterings on the same graph, best used in
   conjunction with \clmdist - because comparing clusterings at
   different levels of granularity should somewhat change the performance
   interpretation. The latter issue is discussed in the \sib{clmdist}
   entry.}

\par{
   \sib{clmmeet} - compute the intersection of a set of clusterings,
   i.e. the largest clustering that is a subclustering of all. Useful
   for measuring the consistency of a set of different clusterings
   at supposedly different levels of granularity (in conjunction with
   \clmdist).}

\par{
   \sib{clmmate} - find best matching clusters between two different
   clusterings.}

\par{
   \sib{clmclose} - fetch connected components from graphs or subgraphs.}

\par{
   \sib{clmimac} - interpret MCL iterands as clusterings. The clusterings
   associated with early iterands may contain overlap, should you be
   interested therein.}

\par{
   \sib{clmresidue} - extend a clustering of a subgraph onto a clustering
   of the larger graph.}

\par{
   \sib{clmformat} - display clusters suitable for scrutinizing.}

\par{
   \sib{clmorder} - reorder indices to represent blocks from
   different clusterings.}

\par{
   \sib{mclpipeline} - set up a pipeline from data parsing stage
   unto clustering format/display stage.}

\par{
   \sib{mclblastline} - BLAST specific pipeline.}

\par{
   \sib{mcxdeblast} - BLAST parser. Can be used to directly stream
   a graph into \mcl. Can also prepare input for mcxassemble
   or can be plugged into the heavy-weight mclblastline.}

\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}
\par
   The first set of utilities implements various
   kinds of general purpose manipulation of matrices in MCL format
   (most notably for multiplying, transposing, pruning, and normalizing).
   Currently this set contains \bf{mcx}, \bf{mcxsubs}, and \bf{mcxmap}.

   The first, \bf{mcx}, is an interpreter for a stack language
   that provides comprehensive access to the mcl librarires.
   The mcl algorithm itself is easily implemented in two or three
   lines of code in this language.
   The second utility, \bf{mcxsubs}, is an all-round extractor
   of submatrices induced by unions and complements of clusters and/or
   simple indices.  Useful for all kinds of things, like studying results you
   find surprising - \it{why did this index not go into this cluster?}
   - \it{why did these clusters (not) merge together?} or just gaining
   insight - \it{what edges exist between these two sets of nodes?}
   et cetera.  Indices in mcxsub output can be tagged with the index
   of the cluster that they are in. The subpart specification strings,
   which are supplied as command line arguments, are quite powerful.
   \bf{mcxmap} is for relabeling graph nodes or matrix indices.

\par
   The third set is for analyzing clustering output.  The
   utilities herein are also very useful;
  - \bf{clminfo} for measuring the efficiency and other characteristics
   of a clustering (e.g. how much edge mass does the clustering capture, how
   large is the cluster footprint).
  - \bf{clmdist} for measuring
   the similarity between two different clusterings and for measuring whether
   one clustering is almost a subclustering of the other.
  - \bf{clmmeet} for computing
   the meet or intersection of an arbitrary number
   of clusterings. The intersection is the largest clustering that is a
   subclustering of all the given clusterings, and it can be used to identify
   areas of the graph that are the most active under parameter shifts.
  - \bf{clmformat} for displaying cluster results in terms
   of descriptive labels (rather than the indices MCL works with)
   and measuring how well nodes fit in the cluster
   they are in, what other clusters are relevant for that node,
   and how cohesive the clusters of a given clustering are.
  - \bf{clmimac} for interpreting matrices as clusterings. The MCL iterands
   allow a generic interpretation as clusterings. This is one of the
   theoretical results that strongly link the MCL process to cluster structure
   in graphs.
  - \bf{clmresidue} for extending a clustering of a subgraph onto a
   clustering of the larger encompassing graph (by a simple majority vote rule).


\sec{mods}{MODULES}

\cpar{BLAST}
   As of the 03-154 release the blast module offers an alternative for the
   TribeMCL module. It is the first of what should become a collection of
   pluggable modules, for bioinformatics as well as for other application
   fields.  It is basically a very small wrapper (\bf{mclblastline}) in which a
   dedicated parser (\bf{mcxdeblast}) is integrated with several core mcl
   (sibling) applications.  The module is enabled by adding \bf{--enable-blast}
   to the configure options, and manual pages for mclblastline, mcxdeblast, and
   mclpipeline (implementing the generic mcl pipeline) are shipped with the
   distribution.
