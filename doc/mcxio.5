.SH NAME
mcxio \- the format specifications for input and output in the mcl family\&.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This document describes

.ZI 3m "native matrix input format"
\&
.br
The format that can be read in by any mcl application
expecting a matrix argument\&. The native format closely resembles
the layout of matrices as residing in computer memory\&. There are
two distinct encodings, respectively \fIinterchange\fP and \fIbinary\fP\&.
Their relative merits are described further below\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "raw intermediate format"
\&
.br
This is read by \fBmcxassemble(1)\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "tab format"
\&
.br
Used by applications such as \fBmcl(1)\fP and \fBmcxdump(1)\fP to
convert between meaningful labels describing the input data and the
numerical identifiers used internally\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "label format"
\&
.br
The format used when streaming labels directly into
\fBmcl(1)\fP or \fBmcxload(1)\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "transformation syntax"
\&
.br
The syntax accepted by \fBmcl(1)\fP, \fBmcxload(1)\fP, \fBmcxsubs(1)\fP
and \fBmcxassemble(1)\fP to transform values in an input stream
or in input or output matrices\&.
.in -3m

The interchange format is a portable format that can be transmitted
across computers and over networks and will work with any version
of mcl or its sibling programs\&. It is documented (here) and very stable\&.
Applications can easily create matrices in this format\&.
The drawback of interchange format is that for very large graphs
matrix encodings grow very big and are slow to read\&.

The binary format is \fInot\fP garantueed to be portable across
machines or different versions of mcl or differently compiled
versions of mcl\&. Its distinct advantage is that for very large
graphs the speed advantage over interchange format can be
significant\&.

Conversion between the two formats is easily achieved with
\fBmcxconvert(1)\fP\&. Both \fBmcl(1)\fP and \fBmcxload(1)\fP
can save a matrix in either format after constructing it from
label input\&.

A remark on the sloppy naming conventions used for \fBmcl\fP and its sibling
utilities may be in order here\&. The prefix \fBmcx\fP is used for generic
matrix functionality, the prefix \fBclm\fP is used for generic cluster
functionaliy\&. The \fIutility\fP \fBmcx\fP is a general purpose interpreter for
manipulating matrices (and grahps, sets, and clusterings)\&. The set of all
\fBmcl\fP siblings (cf\&. \fBmclfamily(7)\fP) is loosely refered to as the mcl
family, which makes use of the mcl libraries (rather than the mcx
libraries)\&. The full truth is even more horrible, as the mcl/mcx prefix
conventions used in the C source code follow still other rules\&.

In this document, \&'MCL\&' means \&'the mcl setting\&' or \&'the mcl family\&'\&. An MCL
program is one of the programs in the mcl family\&. The remainder of this
document contains the following sections\&.

.SH Internal representation of matrices in MCL

There are several aspects to the way in which MCL represents matrices\&.
Internally, indices never act as an ofset in an array, and neither do they
participate in ofset computations\&. This means that they purely act as
identifiers\&. The upshot is that matrices can be handled in which the index
domains are \fInon-sequential\fP (more below)\&. Thus one can work with
different graphs and matrices all using subsets of the same set of
indices/identifiers\&. This aids in combining data sets in different ways and
easily comparing the respective results when experimenting\&. Secondly, only
\fInonzero values\fP (and their corresponding indices) are stored\&. Thirdly,
MCL stores a matrix as a listing of columns\&. Iterating over a column is
trivial; iterating over a row requires a costly transposition computation\&.
The last two points should matter little to the user of MCL programs\&.

In textbook expositions and in many matrix manipulation implementations,
matrices are represented with sequentially indexed rows and columns, with
the indices usually starting at either zero or one\&. In the MCL setting, the
requirement of sequentiality is dropped, and it follows naturally that no
requirement is posed on the first index\&. The only requirement MCL poses on
the indices is that they be nonnegative, and can be represented by the
integer type used by MCL\&. On many machines, the largest allowable integer
will be 2147483647\&.

MCL associates two domains with a matrix\ \&\fCM\fP, the row domain and column
domain\&. The matrix\ \&\fCM\fP can only have entries\ \&\fCM[i,j]\fP where\ \&\fCi\fP is
in the row domain and\ \&\fCj\fP is in the column domain\&. This is vital when
specifying a matrix: it is illegal to specify an entry\ \&\fCM[i,j]\fP violating
this condition\&. However, it is not necessary to specify \fIall\fP
entries\ \&\fCM[i,j]\fP for all possible combinations of\ \&\fCi\fP and\ \&\fCj\fP\&. One
needs only specify those entries for which the value is nonzero, and only
nonzero values will be stored internally\&. In the MCL matrix format, the
matrix domains must be specified explicitly if they are not canonical (more
below)\&.

\fBStrictly as an aside\fP, the domains primarily exist to ensure data
integrity\&. When combining matrices with addition or multiplication (e\&.g\&.
using the \fBmcx\fP utility), MCL will happily combine matrices for which the
domains do not match, although it will usually issue a warning\&.
Conceptually, matrices auto-expand to the dimensions required for the
operation\&. Alternatively, a matrix can be viewed as an infinite quadrant,
with the domains delimiting the parts in which nonzero entries may exist\&.
In the future, facilities could be added to MCL (c\&.q\&. \fBmcx\fP) to allow for
placing strict domain requirements on matrices when submitted to binary
operations such as addition and multiplication\&.
.SH Specifying matrices

From here on, all statements about matrices and graphs are really statements
about matrices and graphs \fIin the MCL setting\fP\&. The \fIspecification\fP
of a matrix quite closely matches the internal representation\&.

A matrix M has two domains: the column domain and the row domain\&. Both
simply take the form of a set (represented as an ordered list) of indices\&. A
\fIcanonical domain\fP is a domain of some size \fCK\fP where the indices are
simply the first \fCK\fP nonnegative integers \fC0,1\&.\&.,K-1\fP\&. The domains
dictate which nonzero entries are allowed to occur in a matrix; only entries
M[i,j] are allowed where i is in the row domain and j is in the column
domain\&.

The matrix M is specified in three parts, for which the second is optional\&.
The parts are:

.ZI 3m "Header specification"
\&
.br
This specifies the dimensions K and L of the matrix, where K is the
size of the row domain, and L is the size of the column domain\&.
It looks as follows:

.nf \fC
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 9x14
)
.fi \fR

This dictates that a matrix will be specified for which the row
domain has dimension 9 and the column domain has dimension 14\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "Domain specification"
\&
.br
The domain specification can have various forms: if nothing is specified,
the matrix will have canonical domains and a canonical representation,
similar to the representation encountered in textbooks\&. Alternatively, the
row and column domains can each be specified separately, and it is also
possible to specify only one of them; the other will simply be a canonical
domain again\&. Finally, it is possible to declare the two domains identical
and specify them simultaneously\&. It is perfectly legal in each case to
explicitly specify a canonical domain\&. It is \fIrequired\fP in each case
that the number of indices listed in a domain corresponds with the dimension
given in the header\&.

An example where both a row domain and a column domain are specified:

.nf \fC
(mclrows
 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 $
)
(mclcols
 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 56 58 $
)
.fi \fR

This example combines with the header given above, as the dimensions fit\&.
Had the row domain specification been omitted, the row domain would
automatically be set to the integers \fC0,1,\&.\&.8\fP\&. Had the column
specification been omitted, it would be set to \fC0,1,\&.\&.13\fP\&.

Suppose now that the header did specify the dimensions 10x10\&.
Because the dimensions are identical, this raises the possibility
that the domains be identical\&.
A valid way to specify the row domain and column domain in one go is this\&.

.nf \fC
(mcldoms
 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 100 $
)
.fi \fR

.in -3m

.ZI 3m "Matrix specification"
\&
.br
The matrix specification starts with the sequence

.nf \fC
(mclmatrix
begin
.fi \fR

The \&'begin\&' keyword in the \&'(mclmatrix\&' part is followed by a list of
listings, where the primary list ranges over all column indices in M (i\&.e\&.
indices in the column domain), and where each secondary lists encodes all
positive entries in the corresponding column\&. A secondary list (or matrix
column) starts with the index c of the column, and then contains a listing
of all row entries in c (these are matrix entries M[r,c] for varying r)\&. The
entry M[r,c] is specified either as \&'r\&' or as \&'r:f\&', where f is a float\&. In
the first case, the entry M[r,c] defaults to 1\&.0, in the second case, it is
set to f\&. The secondary list is closed with the \&`$\&' character\&. A full
fledged examples thus looks as follows:

.nf \fC
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 12x3
)
(mclrows
 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 123 456 2147483647 $
)
(mclcols
  0  1  2 $
)
(mclmatrix
begin
0    44 88 99 456 2147483647 $
1    11 66 77 123 $
2    22 33 55 $
)
.fi \fR

Note that the column domain is canonical; its specifiation could have been
omitted\&. In this example, no values were specified\&. See below for more\&.
.in -3m
.SH Specifying graphs
A graph is simply a matrix where the row domain is the same as the column
domain\&. Graphs should have positive entries only\&. Example:

.nf \fC
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 12x12
)
(mcldoms
11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 123 456 2147483647 $
)
(mclmatrix
begin
11    22:2  66:3\&.4  77:3  123:8 $
22    11:2  33:3\&.8  55:8\&.1 $
33    22:3\&.8  44:7  55:6\&.2 $
44    33:7  88:5\&.7  99:7\&.0 456:3 $
55    22:8\&.1  33:6\&.2  77:2\&.9  88:3\&.0 $
66    11:3\&.4  123:5\&.1 $
77    11:3  55:2\&.9  123:1\&.5 $
88    44:5\&.7  55:3\&.0  99:3\&.0 456:4\&.2 $
99    44:7\&.0  88:3\&.0 456:1\&.8 2147483647:3\&.9 $
123   11:8  66:5\&.1  77:1\&.5 $
456   44:3  88:4\&.2  99:1\&.8 2147483647:6\&.3 $
2147483647   99:3\&.9 456:6\&.3 $
)
.fi \fR

Incidentally, clustering this graph with mcl, using default parameters,
yields a cluster that is represented by the 12x3 matrix shown earlier\&.

The following example shows the same graph, now represented on a
canonical domain, and with all values implicitly set to 1\&.0:

.nf \fC
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 12x12
)
(mclmatrix
begin
0    1  5  6  9 $
1    0  2  4 $
2    1  3  4 $
3    2  7  8 10 $
4    1  2  6  7 $
5    0  9 $
6    0  4  9 $
7    3  4  8 10 $
8    3  7 10 11 $
9    0  5  6 $
10   3  7  8 11 $
11   8 10 $
)
.fi \fR

\fBAdditional notes\fP
.br
There are few restrictions on the format that one might actually expect\&.
Vectors and entries may occur in any order and need not be sorted\&.
Repeated entries and repeated vectors are allowed but are always
discarded while an error message is emitted\&.

If you want \fIfunctionally interesting behaviour\fP in combining
repeated vectors and repeated entries, have a look at the next section
and at \fBmcxassemble(1)\fP\&.

Within the vector listing, the \&'#\&' is a token that introduces
a comment until the end of line\&.
.SH Raw format

A file in \fIraw format\fP is simply a listing of vectors without any
sectioning structure\&. No header specification, no domain specification, and
no matrix introduction syntax is used - these are supplied to the processing
application by other means\&. The end-of-vector token \&'$\&' must still be used,
and the comment token \&'#\&' is still valid\&. \fBmcxassemble(1)\fP
imports a file in raw
format, creates a native matrix from the data therein, and writes the
matrix to (a different) file\&. It allows customizable behaviour in how to
combine repeated entries and repeated vectors\&. This is typically used in the
following procedure\&. A) Do a one-pass-parse on some external cooccurrence
file/format, generate raw data during the parse and write it to file
(without needing to build a huge data structure in memory)\&. B) mcxassemble
takes the raw data and assembles it according to instruction into a native
mcl matrix\&.
.SH Tab format / label information
Several mcl programs accept options such as \fB-tab\fP, \fB-tabc\fP,
\fB-tabr\fP, \fB-use-tab\fP, \fB-strict-tab\fP,
and \fB-extend-tab\fP\&.
The argument to these options is invariably the name of
a so-called \fItab file\fP\&.
Tab files are used to convert between labels (describing entities
in the data) and indices as used in the mcl matrix format\&.
In a tab file each line starts with a unique number which presumably
corresponds to an index used in a matrix file\&.
The rest of the line contains a
descriptive string associated with the number\&. It is required
that each string is unique, although not all mcl programs enforce
this at the time of writing\&.
Lines starting with
\fC#\fP are considered comment and are disregarded\&.

\fBTab domain\fP
.br
The ordered set of indices found in the tab file
is called the \fItab domain\fP\&.

Tab files are almost always employed in conjunction with an mcl matrix file\&.
\fBmcxdump(1)\fP and \fBclmformat(1)\fP require by
default that the tab domain coincides with the matrix domain (either row or
column or both) to which they will be applied\&. This can be relaxed for
either by supplying the \fB--lazy-tab\fP option\&.

mcl provides explicit modes for dealing with tab structures by means of
the \fB-extend-tab\fP, \fB-restrict-tab\fP and
\fB-strict-tab\fP options\&. Refer to the \fBmcl(1)\fP
documentation\&.
.SH Label input
Label input is a line based input where two nodes and a value
are specified on each line\&. The nodes should be specified
by labels containing no whitespace\&. A line thus consists
of two labels and a numerical value, all separated by
whitespace\&. Any line where the first non-whitespace
character is the octothorp (#) is ignored\&.
The following is an example of label input\&.

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
---8<------8<------8<------8<------8<---
# the cat and the hat example
cat hat  0\&.2
hat bat  0\&.16
bat cat  1\&.0
bat bit  0\&.125
bit fit  0\&.25
fit hit  0\&.5
hit bit  0\&.16
--->8------>8------>8------>8------>8---
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

\fBmcl(1)\fP can read in label input and cluster it when it is
given the \fB--abc\fP option\&. It can optionally save
the input graph in native format and save the label information
in a tab file with the \fB-save-graph\fP and \fB-save-tab\fP
options\&.

Refer to the \fBMCL getting started\fP and
\fBMCL manual examples\fP sections
for more information on how MCL deals with label input\&.

\fBmcxload(1)\fP is a general purpose program for reading
in label data and other stream formats\&. It
encodes them in native mcl format and tab files\&.
It allows intermediate transformations on the values\&.
.SH Transformation syntax
\fBmcl(1)\fP, \fBmcxload(1)\fP, \fBmcxsubs(1)\fP, \fBmcxassemble(1)\fP
all accept the same transformation language in their
respective \fBtf\fP-type options and mcxsub\&'s \fBval\fP
specification\&.

A statement in this language is simply a comma-separated
list of functions accepting a single numerical value\&.
The syntax of a function invocation in general is
\fBfunc\fP(\fIarg\fP)\&.
The functions \fBexp\fP, \fBlog\fP, \fBneglog\fP can
also be given an empty parameter list, indicating that
\fIe\fP is taken as the exponent base\&. In this case,
the invocation looks like \fBfunc\fP()\&. The following
functions are supported\&.

.ZI 9m "lt"
Filter out values greater than or equal to arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "lq"
Filter out values greater than arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "gq"
Filter out values less than arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "gt"
Filter out values less than or equal to arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "ceil"
Set everything higher than arg to arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "floor"
Set everything lower than arg to arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "mul"
Multiply by arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "add"
Add arg to it\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "power"
Raise to power arg\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "exp"
Raise arg (\fIe\fP if omitted) to value\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "log"
Take log in base arg (\fIe\fP if omitted)\&.
.in -9m

.ZI 9m "neglog"
Take minus log in base arg (\fIe\fP if omitted)\&.
.in -9m

\fBNOTE\fP
.br
\fBmcl(1)\fP accepts \fB--abc-log\fP and \fB--abc-neg-log\fP to specify
log transformations\&. Similarly, \fBmcxload(1)\fP accepts \fB--stream-log\fP
and \fB--stream-neg-log\fP\&. The reason is that probabilities are
sometimes encoded below the precision dictated by the IEEE (32 bit) float
specification\&. This poses a problem as the mcl applications encode values
by default as floats, and the transformation specifications are always
applied to the mcl encoding\&. The options just mentioned are applied
after a value has been read from an input stream and \fIbefore\fP it
is converted to the native encoding\&.
