\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}

\par
   The cluster file presumably contains a clustering of a subgraph of the
   graph\~\v{G} contained by the matrix file, implying that the row domain of
   that clustering is a subset of the node domain of the graph. clmresidue will
   compute a simple upwards projection of that clustering, resulting in a
   clustering of\~\v{G}. 

\sec{options}{OPTIONS}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\defopt{-rpm}{fname}{residue projection matrix}}
   The name for the file in which the residue projection matrix is stored.
   It contains for each node and for each cluster in the input clustering
   the combined weight of the (edges to the) neighbours of that node
   in that cluster.

\par
   The default output file name is \v{out.rpm}.

\item{\defopt{-mvp}{fname}{majority vote projection (clustering)}}
   The name for the file in which the majority vote projection clustering
   is stored. Aka the majority vote projection clustering storage file name.

\par
   This embodies a very crude approach to distributing the missing nodes in the
   input clustering onto that same cluster.  For each node, the cluster is
   taken for which the residue projection is the largest (see above). The
   residue (i.e. the set of missing nodes) is initially viewed as a cluster;
   the set of nodes for which the projection is largest for the residue itself
   will form a new cluster, if it is not empty.

\par
   The default output file name is \v{out.mvp}.

\item{\defopt{--adapt}{allow domain mismatch}}
   Allow the clustering domain to contain nodes not present in the graph
   domain. \clmresidue will take the appropriate subclustering.
