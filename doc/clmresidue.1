.SH NAME
clmresidue \- extend clustering of subgraph to clustering of graph\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBclmresidue\fP
\fB-icl\fP fname (\fIinput clustering\fP)
\fB-imx\fP fname (\fIinput graph\fP)
\fB[-rpm\fP fname (\fIresidue projection matrix\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[--adapt\fP (\fIallow domain mismatch\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[-mvp\fP fname (\fImajority vote projection (clustering)\fP)\fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION

The cluster file presumably contains a clustering of a subgraph of the
graph\ \&\fCG\fP contained by the matrix file, implying that the row domain of
that clustering is a subset of the node domain of the graph\&. clmresidue will
compute a simple upwards projection of that clustering, resulting in a
clustering of\ \&\fCG\fP\&.
.SH OPTIONS

.ZI 3m "\fB-rpm\fP fname (\fIresidue projection matrix\fP)"
\&
.br
The name for the file in which the residue projection matrix is stored\&.
It contains for each node and for each cluster in the input clustering
the combined weight of the (edges to the) neighbours of that node
in that cluster\&.

The default output file name is \fCout\&.rpm\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-mvp\fP fname (\fImajority vote projection (clustering)\fP)"
\&
.br
The name for the file in which the majority vote projection clustering
is stored\&. Aka the majority vote projection clustering storage file name\&.

This embodies a very crude approach to distributing the missing nodes in the
input clustering onto that same cluster\&. For each node, the cluster is
taken for which the residue projection is the largest (see above)\&. The
residue (i\&.e\&. the set of missing nodes) is initially viewed as a cluster;
the set of nodes for which the projection is largest for the residue itself
will form a new cluster, if it is not empty\&.

The default output file name is \fCout\&.mvp\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--adapt\fP (\fIallow domain mismatch\fP)"
\&
.br
Allow the clustering domain to contain nodes not present in the graph
domain\&. \fBclmresidue\fP will take the appropriate subclustering\&.
