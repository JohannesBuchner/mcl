.SH NAME
clmimac \- Interpret Matrices (c\&.q\&. MCL iterands output by \fBmcl\fP) As Clusterings\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBclmimac\fP -imx <fname> [options]

\fBclmimac\fP
\fB-imx\fP fname (\fIinput file\fP)
\fB[-o\fP fname (\fIname/stem for output\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[-dag\fP fname (\fIoutput DAG\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[--enstrict\fP (\fIremove overlap\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[-sort\fP str (\fIsize|revsize|lex|none\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[-h\fP (\fIlist help\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[--apropos\fP (\fIlist synopsis of all options\fP)\fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION

Use \fBclmimac\fP to interpret matrices (as clusterings) output by \fBmcl\fP using
\fBmcl\fP\&'s \fB-dump\fP\ \&\fBite\fP option\&.

Use \fBclmimac\fP only if you have a special reason; the normal usage
of \fBmcl\fP is to do multiple runs for varying \fB-I\fP parameters
and use the clusterings output by \fBmcl\fP itself\&.
One reason is if you are interested in clusterings with overlap;
early MCL iterands generally induce clusterings possessing overlap\&.
Another reason is to investigate how the cluster structure
associated with the MCL process evolves over time\&.
.SH OPTIONS

.ZI 3m "\fB-imx\fP fname (\fIinput file\fP)"
\&
.br
The input file is presumably an MCL iterand resulting
from the mcl option \fB-dump\fP\ \&\fBite\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-o\fP fname (\fIfile name/stem\fP)"
\&
.br
Write to file named \fIfname\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-dag\fP fname (\fIoutput DAG\fP)"
\&
.br
Write the DAG (directed acyclic graph) constructed from the input to
file\&. This DAG is constructed according to the structure associated
with diagonally positive semi-definite matrices as described
in the PhD thesis \fIGraph clustering by flow simulation\fP\&.
Consult \fBmclfamily(7)\fP for references\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-sort\fP str (\fIsize|revsize|lex|none\fP)"
\&
.br
Sort the clusters either by increasing size, decreasing size,
lexicographically by the indices they contain, or use the clustering
exactly as obtained from the interpretation routine\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--enstrict\fP (\fIremove overlap\fP)"
\&
.br
Remove overlap should it be found, by allocating the nodes
in overlap to the first cluster in which they were found\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-h\fP (\fIlist help\fP)"
\&
.br
Print help, this could possibly be the same output as
supplied with \fB--apropos\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--apropos\fP (\fIlist synopsis of all options\fP)"
\&
.br
List a one-line synopsis for all options\&.
