<h2>NAME</h2>

mcxio - the format specification for matrix input and output in the mcl family.</p>

<a name="description"></a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
This document describes the <i>generic matrix format</i>
used in the mcl libaries. It also describes the <i>raw intermediate
format</i> used by <a class="local" href="mcxassemble.html">mcxassemble</a>.
The two formats (generic and raw) are in fact
identical at the vector level; they are distinguished by the error reporting
implied by the generic format.
<p class="default L50">
A remark on the sloppy naming conventions used for <b>mcl</b> and its sibling
utilities may be in order here. The prefix <b>mcx</b> is used for generic
matrix functionality, the prefix <b>clm</b> is used for generic cluster
functionaliy. The <i>utility</i> <b>mcx</b> is a general purpose interpreter for
manipulating matrices (and grahps, sets, and clusterings). The set of all
<b>mcl</b> siblings (cf. <a class="local" href="mclfamily.html">mclfamily</a>) is loosely refered to as the mcl
family, which makes use of the mcl libraries (rather than the mcx
libraries). The full truth is even more horrible, as the mcl/mcx prefix
conventions used in the C source code follow still other rules.
<p class="default L50">
In this document, 'MCL' means 'the mcl setting' or 'the mcl family'. An MCL
program is one of the programs in the mcl family. The remainder of this
document contains the following sections.

<h2>Internal representation of matrices in MCL</h2>
<p class="default L50">
There are several aspects to the way in which MCL represents matrices.
Internally, indices never act as an ofset in an array, and neither do they
participate in ofset computations. This means that they purely act as
identifiers. The upshot is that matrices can be handled in which the index
domains are <i>non-sequential</i> (more below). Thus one can work with
different graphs and matrices all using subsets of the same set of
indices/identifiers. This aids in combining data sets in different ways and
easily comparing the respective results when experimenting. Secondly, only
<i>nonzero values</i> (and their corresponding indices) are stored. Thirdly,
MCL stores a matrix as a listing of columns. Iterating over a column is
trivial; iterating over a row requires a costly transposition computation.
The last two points should matter little to the user of MCL programs.
<p class="default L50">
In textbook expositions and in many matrix manipulation implementations,
matrices are represented with sequentially indexed rows and columns, with
the indices usually starting at either zero or one. In the MCL setting, the
requirement of sequentiality is dropped, and it follows naturally that no
requirement is posed on the first index. The only requirement MCL poses on
the indices is that they be nonnegative, and can be represented by the
integer type used by MCL. On many machines, the largest allowable integer
will be 2147483647.
<p class="default L50">
MCL associates two domains with a matrix&nbsp;<tt>M</tt>, the row domain and column
domain. The matrix&nbsp;<tt>M</tt> can only have entries&nbsp;<tt>M[i,j]</tt> where&nbsp;<tt>i</tt> is
in the row domain and&nbsp;<tt>j</tt> is in the column domain. This is vital when
specifying a matrix: it is illegal to specify an entry&nbsp;<tt>M[i,j]</tt> violating
this condition. However, it is not necessary to specify <i>all</i>
entries&nbsp;<tt>M[i,j]</tt> for all possible combinations of&nbsp;<tt>i</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>j</tt>. One
needs only specify those entries for which the value is nonzero, and only
nonzero values will be stored internally. In the MCL matrix format, the
matrix domains must be specified explicitly if they are not canonical (more
below).
<p class="default L50">
<b>Strictly as an aside</b>, the domains primarily exist to ensure data integrity.
When combining matrices with addition or multiplication (e.g. using the <b>mcx</b>
utility), MCL will happily combine matrices for which the domains do not
match, although it will usually issue a warning. Conceptually, matrices
auto-expand to the dimensions required for the operation.
Alternatively, a matrix can be viewed as an infinite
quadrant, with the domains delimiting the parts in which nonzero entries may
exist. In the future, facilities could be added to MCL (c.q. <b>mcx</b>) to
allow for placing strict domain requirements on matrices when submitted to
binary operations such as addition and multiplication.

<h2>Specifying matrices</h2>
<p class="default L50">
From here on, all statements about matrices and graphs are really statements
about matrices and graphs <i>in the MCL setting</i>. The <i>specification</i>
of a matrix quite closely matches the internal representation.
<p class="default L50">
A matrix M has two domains: the column domain and the row domain. Both
simply take the form of a set (represented as an ordered list) of indices. A
<i>canonical domain</i> is a domain of some size <tt>K</tt> where the indices are
simply the first <tt>K</tt> nonnegative integers <tt>0,1..,K-1</tt>. The domains
dictate which nonzero entries are allowed to occur in a matrix; only entries
M[i,j] are allowed where i is in the row domain and j is in the column
domain.
<p class="default L50">
The matrix M is specified in three parts, for which the second is optional.
The parts are:
<div style="margin-top:1em">
<table
cellspacing="0" border=0
cellpadding="0" summary="itemize">
<tr><td colspan=3>Header specification</td></tr><tr><td width=32>&nbsp;</td><td width=8>&nbsp;</td><td><div style="text-align:justify">
<p class="default L50">
This specifies the dimensions K and L of the matrix, where K is the
size of the row domain, and L is the size of the column domain.
It looks as follows:
<pre>
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 9x14
)</pre>
This dictates that a matrix will be specified for which the row
domain has dimension 9 and the column domain has dimension 14.
</div></td></tr><tr><td width=32>&nbsp;</td><td width=8>&nbsp;</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>Domain specification</td></tr><tr><td width=32>&nbsp;</td><td width=8>&nbsp;</td><td><div style="text-align:justify">
<p class="default L50">
The domain specification can have various forms: if nothing is specified,
the matrix will have canonical domains and a canonical representation,
similar to the representation encountered in textbooks. Alternatively, the
row and column domains can each be specified separately, and it is also
possible to specify only one of them; the other will simply be a canonical
domain again. Finally, it is possible to declare the two domains identical
and specify them simultaneously. It is perfectly legal in each case to
explicitly specify a canonical domain. It is <i>required</i> in each case
that the number of indices listed in a domain corresponds with the dimension
given in the header.
<p class="default L50">
An example where both a row domain and a column domain are specified:
<pre>
(mclrows
 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 $
)
(mclcols
 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 56 58 $
)</pre>
This example combines with the header given above, as the dimensions fit.
Had the row domain specification been omitted, the row domain would
automatically be set to the integers <tt>0,1,..8</tt>. Had the column specification
been omitted, it would be set to <tt>0,1,..13</tt>.
<p class="default L50">
Suppose now that the header did specify the dimensions 10x10.
Because the dimensions are identical, this raises the possibility
that the domains be identical.
A valid way to specify the row domain and column domain in one go is this.
<pre>
(mcldoms
 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 100 $
)</pre>
</div></td></tr><tr><td width=32>&nbsp;</td><td width=8>&nbsp;</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>Matrix specification</td></tr><tr><td width=32>&nbsp;</td><td width=8>&nbsp;</td><td><div style="text-align:justify">
<p class="default L50">
The matrix specification starts with the sequence
<pre>
(mclmatrix
begin</pre>
The 'begin' keyword in the '(mclmatrix' part is followed by a list of listings,
where the primary list ranges over all column indices in M (i.e. indices
in the column domain), and where each
secondary lists encodes all positive entries in the corresponding
column. A secondary list (or matrix column) starts with the index c
of the column, and then contains a listing of all row entries in c
(these are matrix entries M[r,c] for varying r). The entry M[r,c] is
specified either as 'r' or as 'r:f', where f is a float. In the first
case, the entry M[r,c] defaults to 1.0, in the second case, it is set
to f. The secondary list is closed with the `$' character.
A full fledged examples thus looks as follows:
<pre>
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 12x3
)
(mclrows
 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 123 456 2147483647 $
)
(mclcols
  0  1  2 $
)
(mclmatrix
begin
0    44 88 99 456 2147483647 $
1    11 66 77 123 $
2    22 33 55 $
)</pre>
Note that the column domain is canonical; its specifiation could have been
omitted. In this example, no values were specified. See below for more.

<h2>Specifying graphs</h2>
<p class="default L50">
A graph is simply a matrix where the row domain is the same as the column
domain. Graphs should have positive entries only. Example:
<pre>
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 12x12
)
(mcldoms
11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 123 456 2147483647 $
)
(mclmatrix
begin
11    22:2  66:3.4  77:3  123:8 $
22    11:2  33:3.8  55:8.1 $
33    22:3.8  44:7  55:6.2 $
44    33:7  88:5.7  99:7.0 456:3 $
55    22:8.1  33:6.2  77:2.9  88:3.0 $
66    11:3.4  123:5.1 $
77    11:3  55:2.9  123:1.5 $
88    44:5.7  55:3.0  99:3.0 456:4.2 $
99    44:7.0  88:3.0 456:1.8 2147483647:3.9 $
123   11:8  66:5.1  77:1.5 $
456   44:3  88:4.2  99:1.8 2147483647:6.3 $
2147483647   99:3.9 456:6.3 $
)</pre>
Incidentally, clustering this graph with mcl, using default parameters,
yields a cluster that is represented by the 12x3 matrix shown earlier.
<p class="default L50">
The following example shows the same graph, now represented on a
canonical domain, and with all values implicitly set to 1.0:
<pre>
(mclheader
mcltype matrix
dimensions 12x12
)
(mclmatrix
begin
0    1  5  6  9 $
1    0  2  4 $
2    1  3  4 $
3    2  7  8 10 $
4    1  2  6  7 $
5    0  9 $
6    0  4  9 $
7    3  4  8 10 $
8    3  7 10 11 $
9    0  5  6 $
10   3  7  8 11 $
11   8 10 $
)</pre>

<h2>Additional notes</h2>
<p class="default L50">
There are few restrictions on the format that one might actually expect.
Vectors and entries may occur in any order and need not be sorted.
Repeated entries and repeated vectors are allowed but are always
discarded while an error message is emitted.
<p class="default L50">
If you want <i>functionally interesting behaviour</i> in combining
repeated vectors and repeated entries, have a look at the next section
and at <a class="local" href="mcxassemble.html">mcxassemble</a>.
<p class="default L50">
Within the vector listing, the '#' is a token that introduces
a comment until the end of line.

<a name="raw"></a>
<h2>Raw format</h2>
<p class="default L50">
A file in <i>raw format</i> is simply a listing of vectors without any
sectioning structure. No header specification, no domain specification, and
no matrix introduction syntax is used - these are supplied to the processing
application by other means. The end-of-vector token '$' must still be used,
and the comment token '#' is still valid. <a class="local" href="mcxassemble.html">mcxassemble</a>
imports a file in raw
format, creates a generic matrix from the data therein, and writes the
matrix to (a different) file. It allows customizable behaviour in how to
combine repeated entries and repeated vectors. This is typically used in the
following procedure. A) Do a one-pass-parse on some external cooccurrence
file/format, generate raw data during the parse and write it to file
(without needing to build a huge data structure in memory). B) mcxassemble
takes the raw data and assembles it according to instruction into a generic
mcl matrix.
