\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}

\par{
   \clm{info} computes several numbers indicative for the efficiency with
   with a clustering captures the edge mass of a given graph.
   Use it in conjunction with \clm{dist} to determine which clusterings
   you accept. See the EXAMPLES section in \clm{dist}
   for an example of \clm{dist} and \clm{info} (and \clm{meet}) usage.
   Output can be generated for multiple clusterings at the same time.}

\par{
   The \bf{efficiency} factor is described in [1] (see
   the \secref{references} section).  It tries to balance the dual aims of
   capturing a lot of edges or edge weights and keeping the cluster footprint
   or area fraction small.  The efficiency number has several appealing
   mathematical properties, cf. [1]. It is related to, but not derivable from,
   the second and third numbers, the \it{mass fraction} and the
   \it{area fraction}.}

\par{
   The \bf{mass fraction} is defined as follows.
   Let \bf{e} be an edge of the graph. The clustering \it{captures} \bf{e} 
   if the two nodes associated with \bf{e} are in the same cluster.
   Now the mass fraction is the joint weight of all captured edges divided
   by the joint weight of all edges in the input graph.}

\par{
   The \bf{area fraction} is roughly the sum of the
   squares of all cluster sizes for all clusters in the clustering, divided by
   the square of the number of nodes in the graph.  It says \it{roughly},
   because the actual formula uses the quantity \bf{N}*(\bf{N-1}) wherever it
   says square (of \bf{N}) above.  A low/high area fraction indicates a
   fine-grained/coarse clustering.}

\sec{}{OPTIONS}

\'begin{itemize}{\mcx_itemopts}

\item{\defopt{-o}{fname}{output file name}}

\item{\defopt{-pi}{f}{apply inflation beforehand}}
\car{
   Apply inflation to the graph matrix and compute the performance
   measures for the result.}

\item_defopt{-tf}

\items{
   {\defopt{-cl-tree}{fname}{expect file with nested clusterings (cone format)}}
   {\defopt{-cl-ceil}{<num>}{skip (nested) clusters of size exceeding <num>}}
}
\car{
   The specified file should contain a hierarchy of nested
   clusterings such as generated by \mclcm. The output is then
   in a special format, undocumented but easy to understand.
   Its purpose is to help cherrypick a single clustering
   from a tree, in conjunction with the slightly experimental
   and undocumented program \bf{mlmfifofum}.
   }

\par{
   The measure that is used is very slow to compute for large clusters, and
   generally it will be outside any interesting range (i.e. it will be small).
   Use \genopt{-cl-ceil} to skip clusters exceeding the specified size \-
   \clminfo will directly proceed to subclusters if they exist.
   }

\item{\defopt{-cat-max}{num}{do at most num levels}}
\car{
   This only has effect when used with \genopt{-cl-tree}.
   \clm{info} will start at the most fine-grained level, working upwards.
   }

\item{\defopt{--node-all-measures}{dump node-wise criteria for all incident clusters}}
\item{\defopt{--node-self-measures}{dump node-wise criteria for native cluster}}
