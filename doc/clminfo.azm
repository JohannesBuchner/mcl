\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}

\par
   \clminfo computes several numbers indicative for the efficiency with
   with a clustering captures the edge mass of a given graph.
   Use it in conjunction with \clmdist to determine which clusterings
   you accept. See the EXAMPLES section in \sib{clmdist}
   for an example of \clmdist and \clminfo (and \clmmeet) usage.
   Output can be generated for multiple clusterings at the same time.

\par
   The first number is called the \bf{efficiency} and is described in [1] (see
   the \secref{references} section).  It tries to balance the dual aims of
   capturing a lot of edges or edge weights and keeping the cluster footprint
   or area fraction small.  The efficiency number has several appealing
   mathematical properties, cf. [1]. It is related to, but not derivable from,
   the second and third numbers, the \it{mass fraction} and the
   \it{area fraction}.

\par
   The second number is the mass fraction, which is defined as follows.
   Let \bf{e} be an edge of the graph. The clustering \it{captures} \bf{e} 
   if the two nodes associated with \bf{e} are in the same cluster.
   Now the mass fraction is the joint weight of all captured edges divided
   by the joint weight of all edges in the input graph.

\par
   The third number is the area fraction, which is roughly the sum of the
   squares of all cluster sizes for all clusters in the clustering, divided by
   the square of the number of nodes in the graph.  It says \it{roughly},
   because the actual formula uses the quantity \bf{N}*(\bf{N-1}) wherever it
   says square (of \bf{N}) above.  A low/high area fraction indicates a
   fine-grained/coarse clustering.

\par
   The fourth number is the cluster link weight, which is the average
   edge weight over all edges captured by the clustering.

\par
   The fifth number is the graph link weight, which is the average weight
   over all edges in the graph.

\sec{}{OPTIONS}
\begin{itemize}

\item{\defopt{--adapt}{allow domain mismatch}}
   The \useopt{--adapt} option allows the graph domain and cluster domain
   not to match. \clmdist will take the appropriate subclustering and
   subgraph as it goes along.

\item{\defopt{-pi}{f}{apply inflation beforehand}}
   Apply inflation to the graph matrix and compute the performance
   measures for the result.

\item{\defopt{--append-pf}{append performance measures}}
   \clminfo will reread each cluster file and append the computed
   performance measures to it.

\item{\defopt{--append-gr}{append granularity measures}}
   \clminfo will reread each cluster file and append the computed
   granularity measures to it.

\item{\defopt{-tag}{<str>}{write tag=<str> in performance section}}
   When appending, \clminfo will include tag=<str> in the
   performance section. This can be useful e.g. to indicate
   the pre-inflation value corresponding with the section.

\end{itemize}
