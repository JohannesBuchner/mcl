	*	mcl-06-058 released.

	*	Added scripts/minimcl, a 200-line fully functional mcl
		implementation in perl. It only accepts label input and
		has no parameters except inflation. The implementation is
		hash-based rather than array, which may or may not leverage
		sparseness properties.

Sat, 21 Jan 2006

   *  mcl-06-021 released.

   *  This release flushes some work before embarking on a big
      mcxsubs overwrite. Analysis and cache modes have been improved.

   *  mcxsubs excepts path(<index-list>) top-level spec. It sets
      the domain to all nodes participating in all shortest path
      between all members of (the comma-separated) <index-list>.

   *  mcxsubs now works by default on the nil matrix. This makes it
      easy to create domain templates with mcxsubs, e.g.

         mcxsubs 'dom(cr, i(2,3,4))'

      creates an empty matrix on the specified domains.

   *  mcxsubs did not recognize --from-disk and 'ext(disc())' specifications
      cannot be combined and would dereference a NULL pointer. Fixed.

   *  Fixed weed-related bug in mcxsubs (removing rows/columns).

   *  Cleaned up the postprocess/analysis/caching frameworks.
      Exceptions, limitations, and user-second-guessing were removed.  By
      default mcl does not append the log (it used to do this *sometimes*).

   *  Analysis modes try to read a cached graph if it exists.

   *  Added -cache-graphx <fname>. This caches a graph after transformations
      have been applied.

   *  Caching of the input graphs is now done before matrix transformations
      have been applied, but necessarily after stream transformations (if any)
      have been applied in case input is streamed. 

   *  Added -etc option to mcxload to load simple graphs from label-data
      in a line-based format.
      Use -etc-ai to load matrices for which the column labels are not
      specified (e.g. clusterings). mcxload will autoincrement the columns.

   *  Fixed some documentation errors; inserted -abc-tf, --abc-log and
      --abc-neg-log where -stream-tf, --stream-log and --stream-neg-log were
      erroneously used.

   *  Added rand(<pbb-keep>) transformation (the -tf and -abc-tf options).
      Selects each matrix entry with probability <pbb-keep>.

   *  mcl now prints a helpful reminder to cite the appropriate reference.

   *  Added configure-time check for
         void* val = (void*) unsigned_number
      idiom used by the stream interface.

Thu 17 Nov 2005

   *  mcl-05-321 released.

   *  Focus: uniform transformation syntax accross programs, improved
      documentation, especially mcxio. Previous 'ascii' format is now called
      interchange format throughout the documentation.

   *  mcl accepts the -abc-tf option to transform the input stream
      and the -tf option to transform the input matrix (either constructed
      from a stream with --abc or directly read from a stream).

      -abc-tf 'pow(2), ceil(200), gt(20)'

      This squares everything in the input stream, then truncates everything
      larger than 200 to 200, and removes anything less than or equal to 20.
      There are two special transform cases that appear as separate options.

      --abc-log
      --abc-neg-log

      indicate that as the first thing to do the log or negative logarirthm
      should be taken. The reason is that probability scores can get quite low
      and are best represented as doubles (64 bit values); however mcl's
      internal floating point representation is by default float (32 bit
      values).

      This means that blast clustering can be done from columnar format
      like this:

      grep -v '^#' hsfsp.cblast |\
         cut -f 1,2,11  |\
         mcl - --abc --abc-neg-log -tf 'ceil(460), gt(10)'  -o -

      This will make a few people very happy, and bewilder the rest.

      For sake of completeness, ceil(460) because 1e-200 (standard
      BLAST p-value cut-off) corresponds to 1/e/-460.517019 where
      /e/ is the REAL e, namely 2.718281828.

   *  All of
      -  mcxsubs 'val(<spec>)'
      -  mcl -tf <spec>, -abc-tf <spec>
      -  mcxload -tf <spec>, -stream-tf <spec>
      -  mcxassemble -raw-tf <spec> -prm-tf <spec> -sym-tf <spec>

         now accept the same syntax, documented in mcxio(5).

   *  The mcxio manual has gained two sections, one on transformation
      syntax, one on label input.

   *  mcl -cache-graph saves the graph after any transformations have
      been applied to it.

   *  Throughout the documentation, environment variables, and
      logging statements, replaced 'ascii' by 'interchange'.
      MCLXIOASCIIDIGITS is now MCLXIOINTERCHANGEDIGITS. bliss.
      There is still plenty-o-ascii in the ChangeLog below.

Fri, 11 Nov 2005

   *  mcl-05-314 released - major new features.

   *  GRATUITOUS. Bumped the gratuitous version tag to 1.006 - because of
      mcl's new label input munging abilities.

   *  mcl can read label input.

         mcl <fname> --abc [options]

      will read a line based white-space separated label format:
         label1 label2 [value]

      The current default is to resolve repeated entries by taking the maximum
      of the values.

      --abc or --expect-abc
         input is expected to be in label format.

      --abc or --yield-abc
         cluster output will be done with labels.

      -cache-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         the name of the file mcl writes the tab file too.

      -cache-graph <fname> (assumes label input)
         the name of the file mcl writes the input matrix.

      -strict-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         makes MCL use the named tab file and die if labels
         are not found.

      -restrict-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         makes MCL use the named tab file and warn if labels
         are not found.

      -extend-tab <fname> (assumes label input)
         makes MCL use the named tab file and extend it if labels
         are not found.

   *  new utility mcxload with many custom options for reading in
      label data and transforming the associated numerical values,
      storing mappings in tab files and saving a graph in native mcl
      input format.

   *  mcxdeblast acquired --abc-out to stream label input into mcl.

Thu 27 Oct 2005

   *  mcl-05-300 released.

   *  Added Q+A in FAQ on how to get application data into MCL format.

   *  Changed mcxassemble to pick the maximum between repeated entries
      by default.

   *  clmmate was changed to do something reasonable when presented with
      overlapping clusterings.

   *  Changed mcxdeblast to put the tab file in occurrence order by default.

   *  Fixed mcxsubs bug, introduced in last release, where selections never
      materialize unless one mysteriously specifies --rand-merge.

   *  mcxsubs acquired the ext(dist(k)) spec option, where k is a number.
      It applies to graphs and tells to extend the graph on the current
      specification by including neighbours reachable in at most k steps.

      ext(cdisc(k)) and ext(rdisc(k)) exist as well.

      For example, the spec

         'dom(cr, i(0-5)), ext(disc(2)), out(-)'

      first takes the nodes 0-5 and then adds all nodes reachable
      in at most 2 steps.

   *  mcxsubs can now also read a domain from a tab file.
      use -tab <fname> with t() in the dom spec, e.g. dom(cr, i(0-5), t()).

      mcxsubs -imx small.mci -dfac 0.8 'out(-)'

      will now randomly select about 80 percent of the domains.

   *  mcxdump acquired the -sep-lead option to change the col-rowlist
      separator. The -sep option was renamed to -sep-field.

   *  mcxdump can now also be used to restrict tab files.
   
      mcxdump -imx matrix-file -tab tab-file --dump-tabc
      mcxdump -imx matrix-file -tab tab-file --dump-tabr

      The first will output the restriction of the input tab file
      to the matrix column domain.
      The second will do the same for the row domain.

Thu, 29 Sep 2005

   *  mcl-05-272 released

   *  sanitized clmimac, its analysis mode for detecting DAG structure in
      iterands is now functional.

   *  mcl now accepts '-dump lines' to dump simple line-based pairs format.
      With '-dump cat' it will dump all items to the same stream. The name for
      the stream is then taken as the argument to the -o option, rather than
      derived from '-ds dump-stem' option.

      The -dump option now will simply look for substring occurrences
      of its known targets in the argument string. An example is the
      incarnation below.

         -dump ite,lines,cat -o - -di all

      will dump all iterands and the result clustering to stdout
      in a line based format.

   *  fixed bug in mcxassemble/impala; mclsMap{Cols,Rows} would
      not work due to wrongly set mclpAR->n_ivps.

   *  moved dump code from mcxdump to IO library.

   *  In clmdist and its manual page, replaced erroneous mention of Jacquard
      index by Mirkin metric or edge hamming distance.

   *  mcl would not correctly read vectors specified in multiple places,
      now fixed.

   *  mclblastline has changed.
      By default it now only creates a line-based tab-separated dump file.
      This means that by default it is not necessary to have zoem installed.
      zoem *will* be invoked when the --fmt-fancy option is supplied.

   *  mcxdeblast can read from STDIN by setting the filename to '-'.

   *  mcxdeblasts now acts on --score=r as the documentation promises.

   *  clmformat now accepts the --fancy option on top of the
      -dump <fname> option: it will do fancy output as well as dump output.

   *  clmformat will no longer by default output performance measures in dump
      mode. Use --dump-measures to obtain them.

   *  added grok option to clxdo, to obtain clmformat's node stickiness
      and cluster cohesion matrices.

   *  mcl accepts the --unchecked option, after which it will omit
      consistency checks on the input matrix. See below.

   *  Setting the environment variable
         MCLXIOUNCHECKED
      causes consistency checks to be skipped during matrix input read.
      This will speed up applications, but they will likely crash
      when confronted with nonconforming input. Only use with very
      large matrices in binary format and when in a hurry.

   *  added scripts/perllib/mcl/matrix.pm for reading/writing/manipulating
      matrices from perl. It's simple and will not expand into something grand.

Thu, 28 Apr 2005

   *  mcl-05-118 released

   *  fixed matrix read speed problem. Reading a matrix went from
      O(N^2) to O(E) where E is the number of edges (and N the number
      of nodes).

   *  mcxassemble accepts --write-binary option to force binary format.

   *  mcxdump now accepts --no-loops and --force-loops options.

   *  Tweaked binary matrix read routine a bit - optimized full reads.

   *  GRATUITOUS. Bumped the gratuitous version tag to 1.005 - because of the
      input read speed up.

Wed, 6 Apr 2005

   *  mcl-05-096 released

   *  [Joost] added clmorder.azm

   *  Updated mclfamily and mclindex documentation to mention
      clmclose and clmorder.

Thu, 31 Mar 2005

   *  mcl-05-090 released.

   *  Added options to MCL for dumping submatrices during
      iteration. Submatrices are, for now, extended principals, that
      is, all matrix entries for which either the row or the column
      index hits the specified domain.

         -dump-subi <spec>    Specify simple index list
         -dump-subd <spec>    Specify index list via union of domains
         -dump-dom <mx>       Domain matrix file

   *  Added --abc option to mcxdeblast for per-line ID1 ID2 SCORE format.

   *  Significant clean-up of the matrix IO library.

   *  Large rewrite of mcxsubs. It now takes a sane(r) and more
      extendible language for submatrix specifications. Its implementation
      is far less hideous than it used to be.

   *  mcxsubs has --block and --blockc options for taking respectively
      a block diagonal matrix or its complement.  Also, --skin for doing
      manipulations on domains only, and --extend for computing extended
      submatrices.

   *  Added -ax option to MCL, which prints the suffix MCL uses to construct
      the output file name.  This is useful in scripts that depend
      on MCL to create unique (and convenient) filenames. Such as clxcoarse.

   *  Added util scripts clxcoarse and clxdo.
      clxcoarse will currently do 2-level and 3-level clusterings.  clxdo is
      meant to automate simple tasks.  It currently is able to
      - give a granularity count of (presumably) a cluster file.
      - test whether a graph/matrix is undirected/symmetric.
      Both accept the -h option.
         Not yet installed, copy them if needed.

   *  Replaced setenv in src/impala/io.c by putenv. The latter is POSIX,
      the former is not. This caused compilation errors on (some)
      Solaris systems.

   *  Added clmorder which, given a set of input clusterings, computes
      an ordering that tries to put nodes that share many clusters over the
      different clusters nearby, and puts nodes in larger clusters earlier in
      the ordering. It is presumed that the clusterings are successive
      subclusterings, but it need not be strictly the case - clmorder will
      convert the input clusterings to a strictly nested sequence.

         Not yet installed, copy them if needed.
         Not yet documented.

   *  mcxmap has new

         --invert
         --invertc
         --invertr

      options to facilitate use of inverted maps.

   *  Added -my-scheme option to mcl for subtly better default output
      naming capacities. Read the manual for what that means.

   *  Added --lazy-tab to clmformat.

Tue, 9 Nov 2004

   *  mcl-04-314 released, minor fixes.

   *  Some documentation fixes for blast scripts.

   *  Added automatic naming of dumped files.

   *  In automatic output naming, scheme value was not correctly incorporated
      (off by one error).

Mon, 6 Sep 2004

   *  stopgap release: mcl-04-250

   *  mclpipeline/mclblastine used stale mcl options (-do log). Fixed.

   *  Moved doc directory one level higher.

   *  Removed shtest directory.

   *  Moved graph directory one level higher.

   *  Rewrote mcx option parsing, GNU-style now accepted.

Tue, 17 Aug 2004

   *  mcl-04-230 released.

   *  Fixed bug in the interpretation function. In rare cases (where
      an attractor systems had cardinality exceeding one) it would split
      a cluster.

   *  Fixed some very dumb and slack code in the library.
      100-fold speed increase in mcxsubs block extraction - the slack-bugs
      (slugs?) where *that* slack.

      Sped up applications doing much vector calculus by replacing cute
      initializer-callback-equipped mcxNAlloc invocations with plain mcxAlloc.

   *  Fixed mcxdeblast bug surfacing in the combination of --m9 and
      --tab=<tab-file> options.

   *  64-bit compatibility testing and auditing. Not exhaustive.

   *  Moved doc directory one level higher.

   *  Signal mcl!

      Premature exit of the main iteration (and mcl) can be enforced by
      sending mcl the ALRM signal. It will interpret the last iterand as a
      clustering. This can be useful in the extremely rare case where
      an input graph contains the 3x3 flip-flop state as a subgraph
      (after centering, notably). I recently encountered this when
      clustering a very sparse homology graph (to arrive at orthology)
      using -c 4.

   *  Tentative addition to option parsing. GNU-style equivalence
      of --I=3 and -I 3. Horrors!

         mcl foo.mci --I=3 --scheme=6 --te=8

      thus works. On trial.

   *  Immediately after it has finished a run, mcl can optionally reread
      the input graph, and generate performance characteristics for
      the graph/clustering pair. It can also check whether all clusters
      correspond to connected components in the input graph.

   *  Removed the ugly -do and -dont options.
      Use
         Option                     Default     Previous
         --force-connected=X        0           (new)
         --check-connected=X        0           (new)
         --keep-overlap=X           0           -do keep-overlap
         --append-log=X             1           -do write-log
         --show-log=X               0           -do show-log
         --analyze=X                0           -do clm
      Where X can be any string in 1/y/Y/0/n/N/1.

   *  Added clmclose, for retrieving connected components from a graph,
      and for testing whether the domains in a cluster file or domain file
      correspond to connected components in a given graph.

   *  --apropos output looks better.

Wed, 7 Jul 2004

   *  mcl-04-189 released.

   *  Tim Hughes found a bug in mcxassemble, arising from an embarassing
      typo in the underlying library code - fixed.

   *  Joost van Baal pointed out some issues with the LICENSE.
      It has been reworded to nicely ask scientists to behave properly.

Sat, 3 Jul 2004

   *  mcl-04-185 released.
      Mainly fixes for small glitches and documentation updates, and the new
      general purpose application mcxdump for dumping matrix/tab file
      combinations.  Nothing breathtaking.

   *  Added mcxdump, to do a wider range of dump chores (than clmformat
      already does).

   *  mcl --apropos now dumps one-line descriptions of *all* options,
      even the very obscure and never-use-them options.
      This option will propagate to all siblings in the near future,
      as a result of a rewrite of the option-parsing module.

   *  Updated THANKS; Enter Andreas Kahari (OpenBSD port, compile warnings),
      Jason Stajich (mcxdeblast work), and Tim Hughes (bug reports).

   *  Applied mcxdeblast patchlet by Jason Stajich to support parsing
      WU-BLAST format.

   *  Fixed a bug in the zoem macro definition file output by clmformat,
      reported by Tim Hughes.

   *  The mcxdeblast --m9 option now actually works with the ncbi blast -m 9
      option (i.e. skip comments lines).

   *  Fixed several documentation glitches spotted by Joost van Baal.

   *  Added (somewhat terse and makeshift) remarks on the role of zoem in
      mclpipeline/mclblastline manuals, after Joost pointed out that the
      mclblastline/mclpipeline zoem dependency (via clmformat) was not well
      documented.

Tue, 22 Jun 2004

   *  mcl-04-174 released.

   *  Integrated Jason Stajich's tabular blast format parser.
      Restructured mcxdeblast to a great extent.
      Use --m9 to expect tabular BLAST format.
      With mclblastline, use --blast-m9.

   *  mcxdeblast had its default settings changed to resemble those of
      tribemcl.

   *  mclblastline explicitly uses the mcxassemble '-r max' option; it can be 
      be overruled e.g. by issuing --ass-r=add.

   *  clmformat.zmm: Get rid of spurious braces, update special rules to
      pass evaluation.

   *  NOTE
      mclpipeline was streamlined. All mcl-related options now start with
      --mcl, e.g. --mcl-I=3.0, --mcl-scheme=6, etc. Consult the manual pages if
      needed. All format-related options start with --fmt, all assembly related
      options start with --ass. Any of the --mcl, --ass, --fmt options not
      recognized by mclpipeline will simply be stripped of the prefix and
      passed on to the corresponding program.  To use the clmformat
      --dump-pairs option (which is not in the mclpipeline/mclblastline manual)
      with mclpipeline, use --fmt--dump-pairs.

   *  clmformat acquired the --dump-pairs option, for dumping one cluster/node
      pair per single line.

   *  mcxsubs syntax accepts 3%5 syntax, implying the list 3,8,13,18 and so on.
      The syntax can be repeated, e.g. 3%5,6%13 . Use this for quickly thinning
      out a matrix.  mcxsubs also acquired the options

      -dfac <num>
      -cfac <num>
      -rfac <num>

      --rand-discard
      --rand-merge
      --rand-intersect
      --rand-exclusive

      for randomizing subdomain selection, and

      --spec-cols
      --spec-rows
      --spec-doms

      for omitting the final restriction to subdomains of the input matrix. 
      Refer to the manual page for more information.

      Then, the --reread option was renamed --from-disk.

   *  More jury grades!

Wed, 14 Apr 2004

   *  mcl-04-105 released.

   *  Bumped the gratuitous version tag to 1.004. It has been a long time
      since the previous release and much work has been done.

       - clmformat has gotten a pretty zoem face
       - native binary format was revived and integrated into mcxsubs
            (making it orders of magnitudes faster if binary format is used)
       - the MCL IO library has seen a lot of work
       - the underlying utility libraries have seen much work as well
       - a bug in the loop weight assignment spotted by Abel Ureta-Vidal
            was fixed
       - the mcl '-v clusters' verbosity option is new
       - so is the '-dump dag' option
       - mcxsubs now supports simultaneous extraction of
            (possibly overlapping) blocks
       - the environment variables MCLXASCIIDIGITS,  MCLXIOVERBOSITY,
            MCLXIOFORMAT, and MCLXASCIIFLAGS have arrived
       - mcxarray documentation finally got written
       - and various other fixes for glitches went in, thanks to Joost
            van Baal for some of those

   *  Revived binary format.  Reading matrices is roughly 30 times faster
      in binary format.  For an average MCL run, this may result in a 10% gain
      in speed or more.
      Treat with care; binary format is not portable across some subcollection
      of processors/compilers/filesystems.

      Both binary and ascii input now support reading subgraphs directly
      from disk, which is foremost important for mcxsubs.

   *  mcxsubs is now *much* faster if applied to binary format
      and the --reread option is used. The speed gain may be 400-fold.

   *  Big rewrite of clmformat. All the formatting code was taken out,
      and clmformat now outputs logical formatting statements.
      These are in the zoem language, so for using clmformat one
      needs to install the zoem package, obtainable from

         http://micans.org/zoem/src/zoem-latest.tar.gz

      The good thing is that lay-out can now be changed by editing
      a single zoem macro definition file.

   *  The default of assigning loop weights has changed.
      It is now set to equal the maximum weight found in the list of
      neighbours. The old behaviour can be regained by specifying -cma 100.

      NOTE
         The new default will, with identical inflation value and
      compared with the old default, result in slightly more granular
      (more fine-grained) clusterings. This can optionally
      be compensated for by increasing the inflation value a little.

   *  The new -cma <num> option accepts a number inbetween 0 and 100.
      Think of it as a fraction f expressed as a percentage.  It sets the loop
      value to the weighted average
      
         f * ctr + (1-f) * max

      where ctr is the 'center' of a list of entries (the sum of entries
      squared divided by the squared sum of entries) and max is the maximum
      of that list.

      The loop value thus obtained is multiplied by the value given
      to the -c option (which stands default at 1.0).

   *  Improved interpretation interfaces for overlapping clusterings;
      Added mcl '-dump dag' option, and some changes to clmimac.  Use clmimac
      to interpret matrices obtained either with '-dump ite' or '-dump dag' as
      clusterings. For early mcl iterands, such clusterings may possibly
      contain overlap.

   *  Added mcxarray documentation, it is now installed.

   *  Added clmps utility, which is by default not yet installed and
      has no manpage yet. It outputs the body of a PostScript file.

   *  Added '-v clusters' for reporting on intermediate clusters.
      However, if you are *really* interested in intermediate clusterings,
      you should use '-dump ite' and the clmimac application.

   *  All mcl applications (should) respect the environment variable
      MCLXASCIIDIGITS, setting the number of digits after the decimal point
      that should be written for native ascii format. The special value -1
      indicates that no value should be written at all (upon further reads the
      default value 1.0 will be used). This is relevant only for ascii format.

   *  All mcl applications (should) respect the environment variable
      MCLXIOFORMAT, which regulates whether matrices are written in binary
      or ascii format. Consult the mcl manual page for how it works.

   *  All mcl applications (should) respect the environment variable
      MCLXIOVERBOSITY, which regulates whether a progress bar is printed
      during matrix I/O. Consult the mcl manual page for how it works.

   *  Added 'b:' tag to mcxsubs syntax for retrieving block diagonal matrix
      (where blocks can optionally overlap). Some groundwork in the library
      for enabling this.

   *  Added two more pruning schemes; set the default scheme index
      to four rather than two.

   *  Added mcl -in-gq <val> option, for removing any edges in the
      input graph whose weight is below <val>.

   *  Fixed bug in clminfo (spotted by Abel Ureta-Vidal), causing the
      singleton count to be wrong sometimes.

Fri, 03 Oct 2003

   *  mcl-03-276 released.

   *  added clmmate manual page. Use it to find best pairs of
      clusters between two clusterings (use the -twins option).

   *  fixed mcxmap functional bug.

   *  mcxassemble and mcxdeblast were improved, including fixes and
      suggestions from (at different stages) Abel Ureta-Vidal and
      Dinakarpandian Deendayal.

   *  The documentation now uses the zoem manual NAME macro (recently added),
      so that the troff output is apropos (whatis, man -k) compatible.

   *  fixed trivial bug in mclpipeline.

Tue, 02 Sep 2003

   *  mcl-03-245 released (mainly a maintenance release).

   *  Fixed bug which caused mcl and siblings to crash or go haywire (exit
      for the wrong reaon) when presented with non-conforming input.  The bug
      was introduced during the previous IO module rewrite that brought raw
      matrix format and mcxassemble.  So versions >= 03-154 probably feature
      this bug.

   *  Added mcxarray for creating cosine or pearson matrix from microarray
      data.  Not yet installable, no manpage, -h gives manual.

   *  Added speed/complexity section to mclfaq.

   *  Fixed clmmeet, which appeared to be broken since 03-010.

   *  Added mclgraga, a simple script for granularity gauging. Use as in
      clmformat -icl cluster-fu -dump - | mclgraga --range=0,10,2000 (and in
      other ways as well).  It's not installable though and has no manpage.
      One has to copy it from the source distribution

   *  Changed mclgrep to be not installable; one has to copy it from
      the source distribution. It has no manpage either.

   *  clmformat has -dump <stream>, -pi <infl>, -dump-node-sep <sep> options.

   *  clminfo has -pi <infl>, -ap (append performance measures),
      -ag (append granularity measurs), -do/dont <header|rule>  options.

Fri, 04 Jul 2003

   *  mcl-03-185 released (maintenance release).

   *  Added mclgrep, which can grep sections from an mcl file.
      e.g. 'mclgrep clm foo' will display 'clm' section(s) in the file foo,
      if present. Handy for comparing granularity and performance
      characteristics.

   *  Behold the mcl '-do clm' option; it will include performance criteria
      and granularity characteristics in the cluster output file.

   *  Fixed embarassing clminfo bug (introduced in mcl-03-178).

   *  Fixed mcx broken interactive mode (introduced in mcl-03-178).

Fri, 27 Jun 2003

   *  mcl-03-178 released (maintenance release).

   *  Fixed a bug causing the jury marks, the jury synopsis, and the
      pruning percentages to be wrong.

   *  Added several new features, yet to be documented here
      (documented in the manual pages though).
      Look for the mcl -do and -dont options.

Tue, 03 Jun 2003

   *  mcl-03-154 released.

   *  Encouraged the version number up to 1.003.

   *  Added mcxassemble, clmformat, mclpipeline, mclblastline, mcxdeblast.
      Removed clmconf, its functionality was assimilated by clmformat.

   *  Added -pi <pre-inflation> option to mcl for skewing input weights.

   *  Added automatic output naming facilities to mcl.  By default (if the
      -o option is not used) it will write to out.fname.suf, where fname is the
      name of the input file, and suf is automatically constructed. The -ap and
      -aa options allow further customization.

      For example:
         mcl small.mci -I 3 -c 2.5 -pi 0.8 -scheme 5

      will result in a file named
         out.small.mci.I30s5c25pi08

      It is possible to obtain the file name corresponding with a given run
      by using the -az option.

   *  Removed longtime deprecated -a option.

   *  mclpipeline implements a generic pipeline implementing the
      stages from data file (application-specific input) until
      formatted output (clusters represented in terms of
      application-specific labels).

   *  mclblastline implements a particular mcl pipeline tailored
      to BLAST files.

   *  mcxdeblast added, for parsing BLAST files (beta version).

   *  display results in readable form using clmformat.

   *  Added mcxassemble, which takes as input simple raw cooccurrence
      data in a very free format, and turns it into mcl matrix format.
      Options for adding, maxing, multiplying, and discarding repeated
      entries as well as repeated vectors.

      Nodes can be relabeled by specifying a map file.  This makes it
      easy and fast e.g. to do a one-pass Blast file parse, write the
      cooccurrence data and a prefered node labeling, and then construct
      the final matrix.  The setup for transforming application-specific
      data into raw data is this:

      -  Parse cooccurrence data from some external format.
      -  Transform cooccurrence data to raw mcl data as you parse.
      -  When done, write out required header and domain information
            to a separate file. The domain information can be built during
            the parsing stage.
      -  Use mcxassemble to construct a valid matrix from the raw data
            and the header information.
      -  Nodes can be relabeled as needed using a separate map file,
            which takes the form of a very thin matrix file.

   *  mcxmap uses the new permutation/relabeling mechanism; permutations
      are now fully supported.

   *  IO internals underwent major rewrite in order to support mcxassemble
      raw data munging and mapping functionality (in mcxmap and mcxassemble)

   *  Vector part of impala library was made somewhat safer;
      new mclpAR* type for dealing with multisets of ivps.

   *  # now acts as a comment within the (mclmatrix ... ) section,
      onwards from the begin keyword.

   *  MCL should be straigthforward to compile under Wintel using Cygwin,
      as now verified by SvD (small fix was needed; log2 seems defined
      as macro under cygwin).

   *  clean-ups in underlying util and impala libraries.

   *  implemented
         -DVALUE_AS_DOUBLE and
         -DINDEX_AS_LONG compiler options.
      The first for matrix entries cq edge weights, the second
      for matrix indices cq node identifiers.

   *  revamped
      -DRUNTIME_INTEGRITY compiler option.

   *  clm apps now have --version option.

Fri, 10 Jan 2003

   *  mcl-03-010 released.

      This is a MAJOR overhaul, with increased power in the MCL libraries and
      utilities. The mcl family can now deal with a much more general
      representation of matrices/graphs. This is detailed in several benefits
      listed below. There is a drawback: mcl itself is now approximately 15-20
      percent slower than before (measured on not so large graphs).  Some of
      this loss can perhaps be recouped by forthcoming changes; regardless,
      the benefits were deemed to far outweigh this minor performance loss.

   *  Increased version number to 1.002. The difference between versions
      1.001 and 1.002 is much larger than that between versions 1.001 and
      1.002 - the version numbering scheme is very minimalistic.

   *  mcl's input format was extended (existing graphs are still acceptable).
      See mcx(5) / mcxformat.html.

   *  mcl's internals were rewritten to allow fully sparse matrix/graph
      representation. Formely, the nodes of a graph had to be indexed
      sequentially, starting at zero. This is no longer the case.

      mcl can now internally deal with sparsely indexed graphs.
         Example:
       | (mclheader
       | mcltype matrix
       | dimensions 12x12
       | )
       | (mcldoms
       | 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 123 456 789 $
       | )
       | (mclmatrix
       | begin
       | 11    22  66  77  123 $
       | 22    11  33  55 $
       | 33    22  44  55 $
       | 44    33  88  99 456 $
       | 55    22  33  77  88 $
       | 66    11  123 $
       | 77    11  55  123 $
       | 88    44  55  99 456 $
       | 99    44  88 456 789 $
       | 123   11  66  77 $
       | 456   44  88  99 789 $
       | 789   99 456 $
       | )

      Besides being useful from a user-point of view, this new setup is a
      first step in enabling mcl for grid or cluster computing. 

      Look at the mcx(5) / mcxformat.html page for more information.
      
   *  mcl sibling programs are able to handle clusterings in which the
      clusters have nonconsecutive identifiers.

   *  The low level API is now totally permissive of all kinds of domain
      combinations. It is up to higher levels to enforce domain identity or
      subsumption etc. Also,

      The low level API leaves it up to the caller whether a node is not
      represented because it is not part of the domain or whether it is not
      represented because it has no neighbours.  It is up to the higher levels
      to decide.

      The low level API (and most of the higher level API) allows 0x0, Kx0,
      and 0xK matrices.  mcl will happily cluster a 0x0 graph.

   *  renamed the src/nonema directory to src/impala (permanently).
      renamed src/intalg to src/taurus (tentatively).

   *  renamed mcximac to clmimac.

   *  added mcxmap

   *  added clmresidue

   *  clmdist can now also compute the Jacquard index and the variance of
      information measure (the -mode option). Its output looks nicer and can be
      changed using the -parts, -digits, -width, --nolegend, and --noindex
      options.

   *  The underlying library code for clminfo was thoroughly cleansed.
      An untraced FPEfault was reported for earlier versions; hopefully
      that is now gone.

   *  mcl now accepts
         -sort revsize (default, large clusters first)
         -sort size  (small clusters first)
         -sort lex   (lexicographical ordering)
         -sort none  (clusters as found by interpretation routine)

   *  mcxsubs now
         -  acts on rectangular matrices as well.
         -  can select on value (being >=/> low and/or <=/< high).
         -  can remap the domain of a selected matrix to range 0-N-1,
            for only columns, only rows, or both columns and rows.
         -  can make the selected matrix characteristic.
         -  can transpose the final result.
         -  has fairly horrid looking specification strings.

      It can be used for removing tough nodes from a graph, where toughness is
      measured according to output resulting from running mcl with '-dump
      chr'.

   *  fixed problem with documentation in mcl-02-277.
      verbatim env in html looked rotten under IE.

Fri, 4 Oct 2002

   *  mcl-02-277 released.
      Mostly a maintenance release. Perhaps the extra FAQ entry is most
      noteworthy. Read e.g. http://micans.org/mcl/doc/mclfaq.html#checksymmetry
      A new release featuring support for removal/projection of tough nodes is
      in the pipeline. That release will be more interesting.

   *  Added faq {How do I check that my graph/matrix is symmetric/undirected?}
      Please do check this people!

   *  Several additions and fixes in the util library, nothing much affecting
      mcl.

   *  Added field to '-dump chr' output (loop value before rescaling).

   *  Removed unnecessary 'thou shalt not have values < 0' commandment.

   *  Some small doc additions.

Fri, 21 Jun 2002

   *  mcl-02-172 released.

   *  Fixed --log output format error.

   *  Some autotools fixes, and some changes in documentation generation
      (immaterial for mcl users).

   *  [Joost] configure.ac.in: added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE: by default,
      don't rebuild e.g. Makefile.in from Makefile.am.  Default users are
      not maintainers.

Thu, 30 May 2002

   *  mcl-02-150 released.

   *  Applied valgrind to mcl, and fixed all memory leaks thus found.
      Standard computation paths are clean (if no errors).  Inserted several
      clean-up routines.

   *  Retrofitted this file to include version 02-095.

   *  [Joost] Added acinclude.m4, including acx_pthread.m4 by Steven G.
      Johnson and Alejandro Forero Cuervo, so that we'll build out-of-the-box
      on systems like Tru64Unix/OSF1 which need special compiler flags when
      dealing with pthread stuff.  Thanks to Martin Mokrejs for reporting the
      bug.

   *  Fixed bug present in version 02-095 and 02-116, caused by
      the computation of the average of inhomogeneity over all vectors
      and a very buggy mclVectorMaxValue -- it removes all zero entries from
      vectors. Bug, reported by Martin Mokrejs, manifested itself when
      inhomogeneity was exactly zero for all vectors,

   *  Compiled mcl with checkergcc, and tested a few computation paths.
      No errors found.

   *  [Anton] Updated tribe software after bug report by Maring Mokrejs.

   *  [Joost] Separated Zoem from mcl, modularized util and separated it
      as well. It is still tacked on in the distribution though.

   *  [Joost] Enabled --enable-tribe, the tribe module written by Anton
      Enright.

   *  [Anton] Inserted tribe software.

   *  Removed -dump att option, added more general -dump chr option.

Fri, 26 Apr 2002

   *  mcl-02-116 released, bumped version number to 1.001.

   *  Added mcximac utility for interpreting MCL iterands as clusterings.

   *  Automated versioning; documents and --version sensitive apps
      now generate consistent date and version tags.

Fri, 05 Apr 2002

   *  mcl-02-095 released.

   *  Added mclfaq document (supported in html, roff, ps).

   *  Added --log option to mcl, appends a log section to
      the clustering output. MUST-DO for large graphs. It is not a default
      because I don't want to scare new users.  This option works with
      --expand-only as well. Logging includes information on kept mass, vector
      footprints, recoveries, selections, and time taken by expansion.

   *  -nw, -nl, -nj, --log, --show-log, -how-much-ram, --jury-charter are new.

   *  Added extensive window monitoring of mass averages for the worst k
      instances, k=1,2,5,10,20,50 .. 20000, 50000.

   *  The mcl -h output is now less frightening, or so I hope.

   *  Added 'jury synopsis' remark classifying the pruning quality.
      It is meant as indication only. Pruning quality is now measured
      in the following flavours:
         perfect exceptional superior excellent good acceptable mediocre poor
      bad lousy miserable awful wretched atrocious

   *  Streamlined command line parsing a lot, using new util/opt.[ch].
      Separated parsing from validation; the framework should be usable for
      setting parameters when calling mcl parts from code.

   *  Modularized the mcl code a lot. It is now close to being
      usable as shared object code with all the command-line functionality
      still accessible.
         moved the lion's part of shmcl/mcl.c to mcl/alg.c. Created
      mcl/alg.[ch], mcl/proc.[ch], mcl/procinit.[ch] mcl/inflate.[ch],
      mcl/expand.[ch], removed mcl/params.[ch] mcl/mcl.[ch].
      shmcl/mcl.c looks acceptable again.

   *  Added util/opt.[ch] util/err.[ch] mcl/init.[ch],
      added mcxHashMerge to util/hash.[ch], streamlined error messages in
      terms of mcxErr, mcxWarn, mcxTell.

   *  Rewrote the mcl manual page so that all pruning-related options
      are now in a separate section.

   *  Documented existing --dense and --thick flags (unlikely
      you need them though).

   *  Cleaned up html documentation a lot. It should now look good in
      most browsers. Moved from <dl> to <table>

   *  Began first ever so slight reworking of taurus. renamed Ilist to mcxIL
      and its 'list' member to 'L'. Terse!

   *  Compiled zoem util mcl shmcl shcl shmcx shmx nonema
      with gcc -pedantic -Wall -ansi, and fixed all the nitty gritty stuff
      thus found, including an erroneous pthread_create argument cast and two
      functions whose declaration was hidden (not in the header file).

Mon, 04 Mar 2002

   *  mcl-02-063 released.

   *  Fixed the missing '#include <string.h>' in taurus/ilist.c,
      and fixed the bug caused by #defining TRUE and FALSE without
      checking whether they were previously defined.

Wed, 27 Feb 2002
   
   *  mcl-02-058 released.

   *  Mcl-related changes are all updates in the documentation,
      plus small changes in the underlying 'util' library.  No functional
      changes.

   *  Zoem has changed significantly since the previous release.
      It needs to be separated from mcl.  (zoem is the tool with which mcl
      documentation is generated).

Fri, 15 Feb 2002

   *  mcl-02-047 released.

Tue,  5 Feb 2002

   *  mcl-02-035 released.

Wed, 12 Dec 2001

   *  mcl-20011211 released.
