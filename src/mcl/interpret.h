 *  description (short)
 *
 *    Interpret any (nonnegative) stochastic matrix mtx as a clustering via a
 *    mapping explained below, return clustering encoded as matrix. Each vector
 *    in clusterMtx represents a cluster element, the last vector in clusterMtx
 *    represents a garbage vector.  The members of ipretParam affect the number
 *    and size of the clusters and the amount of overlap generated.
 *
 *  more background     
 *
 *    This routine works canonically on stochastic matrices which are
 *    'diagonally positive semi--definite' (dpsd) or doubly idempotent.  Do not
 *    worry about this; see below for the crux. It was designed in a robust
 *    way, and will give meaningful results for all kinds of nonnegative
 *    matrices. However, it is likely that the greatest use of mclInterpret()
 *    lies in applying it to iterands of the MCL process, especially early
 *    iterands. The characteristic property of dpsd matrices is that the
 *    absolute value of each diagonal entry relative to the other (absolute)
 *    values in the vector it is in is governed by special restrictions which
 *    bring forth a cluster interpretation of the (column) indices. The simple
 *    truth, explained in the more specific setting of column stochastic dpsd
 *    matrices, is:

 *    Let A be a column stochastic dpsd matrix.  Write l-->k if A_{ll} <=
 *    A_{kl}.  Then --> induces a directed acyclic graph (DAG) on the column
 *    indices of A, if identical columns are lumped together.  See 'A cluster
 *    process for graphs using stochastic matrices' by Stijn.  The canonical
 *    way to associate a clustering with a DAG is to define each node with no
 *    outgoing arcs (a sink) as the core of a unique clustering.  Each core is
 *    then expanded with all nodes that reach it.  The definition above can
 *    also be applied to nonnegative doubly idempotent stochastic matrices,
 *    which in general need not be dspd (they are dpsd only if every node is an
 *    attractor, which is an exceptional case), yielding the canonical cluster
 *    interpretation of such a matrix.
 *
 *    mclInterpret works by associating a DAG with its input matrix such that
 *    the returned clustering satisfies the definition above for a nonnegative
 *    input matrix which is dpsd or doubly idempotent. However, mclInterpret
 *    does the best it can in associating a DAG with any stochastic matrix, in
 *    a manner which is not affected by the order in which columns and rows are
 *    stored. Moreover, the routine allows a parametrization possibly affecting
 *    the amount of overlap and the number of clusters generated. 'Possibly'
 *    because certain matrices allow only one sensible cluster interpretation,
 *    e.g. doubly idempotent matrices.
 *
 *    The members of mclInterpretParam are used for transforming an input
 *    matrix before interpreting it.  Their values affect whether diagonal
 *    entries survive this transformation or not.  This in turn affects the
 *    resulting clustering.  Basically, the more diagonal entries survive
 *    (which are not maximal in their column), the more overlap will result in
 *    the clustering.  note: The (graph associated with the) transformed matrix
 *    still need not be a DAG.
 *
 *    The sum of the values of the members below should sum to 1 or a number
 *    slightly smaller (e.g. somewhere in between 0.99..0.95), and they should
 *    be nonnegative.  For one thing, this implies that no matter their
 *    relative values, doubly idempotent matrices (which admit only one
 *    sensible clustering) will always be interpreted correctly.  The
 *    transformation works as follows: For each column k a bar is computed. All
 *    values below the bar are removed. The bar equals
 *
 *          w_center    *  (center of column k)
 *          w_selfval   *  (value of kk entry)
 *       +  w_maxval    *  (maximum value in column k)
 *       --------------------------------------------
 *       =  bar
 *
 *    selfval should not be used when extracting the DAG from MCL iterands,
 *    i.e. w_selfval should in that case be 0 (either when mcl writes the
 *    DAG itself [-dump dag], or when clmimac extracts the DAG from iterands
 *    written by mcl [dump ite]).
 *    If subselections of such a DAG are made, w_selfval can be used.
 *
 *    The transformed matrix (call it) T is interpreted as follows.  nodes
 *    which still have a positive return value (corresponding with columns with
 *    nonzero diagonal entry) are considered attractive. If T_{kl} != 0 we say
 *    that l-->k or that l is a parent of k.  A node is also considered
 *    attractive if anywhere in a chain of parents leading to this node, there
 *    is an attractive parent.  Now, each connected subgraph consisting solely
 *    of attractive nodes is taken as the core of a cluster element.  This
 *    corresponds with 'lumping together of identical columns' in the case of
 *    dpsd matrices mentioned above (the columns being the columns associated
 *    with that connected subgraph, and this set of columns subsequently
 *    playing the role of sink).  This core C is extended with (the nodes of)
 *    all chains of parents for which one of the nodes lies in C.  This
 *    corresponds with the act of joining all nodes reaching a specific sink in
 *    a DAG.  This definition and its implementation guarantuee that the
 *    resulting clustering is permutation invariant (i.e. does not depend on
 *    the order in which columns and rows are stored).
